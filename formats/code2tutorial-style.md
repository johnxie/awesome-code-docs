## The Code Walkthrough Approach

Takes **real production code** and transforms it into educational content through detailed explanations and context.

### What Makes It Effective:
- **Real Code Focus** - Uses actual production systems, not toy examples
- **Progressive Explanation** - Builds understanding step by step  
- **Context-Rich** - Explains not just what code does, but why it exists
- **Pattern Recognition** - Highlights reusable design principles

## Great Examples Include:

**Algorithm Deep-Dives** - Breaking down complex algorithms with visual aids  
**System Integration** - How different components work together  
**Performance Analysis** - Optimization techniques with before/after comparisons  
**Architecture Decisions** - Why code is structured in specific ways  

## What We're Looking For

- React Hooks implementation walkthrough
- Database query optimization analysis  
- Distributed system code breakdown
- Security implementation reviews
- Framework internals explanations
