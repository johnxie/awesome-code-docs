# ðŸ§© Interactive Tutorials

> Hands-on learning experiences with runnable code and immediate feedback

## What Makes Great Interactive Documentation

Interactive docs let you **experiment and learn by doing** rather than just reading.

### Key Features:
- **Runnable Examples** - Code you can execute and modify
- **Step-by-Step Guides** - Progressive learning with checkpoints  
- **Immediate Feedback** - See results as you work
- **Easy Setup** - Works out of the box with minimal configuration

## Formats We Love

**Jupyter Notebooks** - Great for data science and AI/ML tutorials  
**Web Playgrounds** - Browser-based coding with live preview  
**Guided Labs** - Step-by-step environment setup with validation  
**Coding Exercises** - Progressive challenges with automated testing  

## Examples We're Looking For

- Jupyter notebooks explaining transformer architectures
- Interactive React component builders  
- Database query optimization playgrounds
- System programming labs with Docker environments
