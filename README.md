# Awesome Code Docs [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> 📚 Technical documentation that actually teaches you how complex systems work

*Quality over quantity - we curate docs that transform understanding, not just list APIs*

## What Makes This Different?

Most documentation tells you **what** to do. The docs here teach you **how** and **why** systems work.

**Look for:**
- 🔍 **Real code examples** from production systems  
- 📊 **Visual explanations** with diagrams and walkthroughs
- 🎯 **Hands-on tutorials** you can actually follow
- ⭐ **Beginner-friendly** but still in-depth
- 🔄 **Recently updated** and actively maintained
