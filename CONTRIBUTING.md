## 🎯 What We're Looking For

We curate documentation that **transforms understanding** - going beyond "what to do" to explain "how it works" and "why it matters."

### ✨ Exceptional Documentation Criteria

| Criterion | Description | Examples |
|:----------|:------------|:---------|
| 🧠 **Transforms Understanding** | Explains systems thinking, not just usage | Architecture deep-dives, algorithm explanations |
| 💻 **Production Focus** | Real codebases, not toy examples | Actual open-source project walkthroughs |
| 📊 **Visual Learning** | Rich diagrams and interactive elements | System diagrams, flowcharts, live demos |
| 🛠️ **Hands-On Practice** | Runnable code you can experiment with | Step-by-step implementations, exercises |
| 📚 **Progressive Learning** | Clear path from beginner to advanced | Structured chapters, prerequisite guidance |
| 🔄 **Current & Maintained** | Updated within the last 12 months | Modern practices, latest versions |

### 🎉 Great Examples Include:

<details>
<summary><strong>📖 Click to see examples of exceptional documentation</strong></summary>

**Architecture Deep-Dives:**
- System design explanations with component diagrams
- Database internals with query execution analysis
- Distributed system patterns with failure scenarios

**Code Walkthroughs:**
- Line-by-line analysis of complex algorithms
- Production codebase architecture tours  
- Performance optimization case studies

**Interactive Learning:**
- Jupyter notebooks with executable examples
- Browser-based coding environments
- Step-by-step tutorial with validation

</details>

### ❌ What We Don't Include:

- Basic "hello world" tutorials without depth
- Pure API documentation without architectural context  
- Marketing content disguised as educational material
- Outdated resources (>2 years without updates)
- Content requiring paid subscriptions to access
