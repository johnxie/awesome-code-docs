# Contributing to Awesome Code Docs

Thanks for helping us build the best collection of educational technical documentation! ðŸŽ‰

## What We're Looking For

We curate documentation that **transforms understanding** - not just API references or basic tutorials.

### Great Documentation Has:

âœ… **Real Learning Value** - Teaches you how systems actually work  
âœ… **Practical Examples** - Code you can run and experiment with  
âœ… **Visual Aids** - Diagrams, charts, or interactive elements  
âœ… **Clear Structure** - Logical progression from basics to advanced topics  
âœ… **Current Info** - Updated within the last year  

### Examples of What Works:
- Architecture deep-dives with system diagrams
- Code walkthroughs from real production systems  
- Interactive tutorials with runnable examples
- Performance analysis with benchmarks
- Step-by-step implementation guides

### What We Don't Include:
- Basic "hello world" tutorials
- Pure API documentation without context
- Marketing content disguised as docs
- Outdated or unmaintained resources
