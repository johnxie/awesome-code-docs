# Chapter 7: Vue Components

The NocoDB frontend composes reusable Vue components for dense data operations.

## Component Groups

- grid and cell editors
- schema/config side panels
- filter/sort/query controls
- form and relation pickers

## UI Engineering Notes

- virtualize large row sets
- debounce expensive query-triggering inputs
- isolate editor state from server sync latency

## Summary

You can now map major frontend responsibilities across NocoDB component layers.
