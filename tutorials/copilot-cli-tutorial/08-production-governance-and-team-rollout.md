# Chapter 8: Production Governance and Team Rollout

Operating Copilot CLI in teams requires policy alignment, permissions governance, and repeatable onboarding.

## Governance Checklist

1. verify Copilot org/enterprise policy permits CLI usage
2. define approved installation/update channels per platform
3. establish model and experimental-feature usage policy
4. standardize MCP/LSP configuration review for security
5. require local validation before merge in agent-assisted flows

## Rollout Pattern

- start with small pilot team
- measure workflow quality and incident patterns
- expand gradually with documented guardrails
