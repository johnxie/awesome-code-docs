# Chapter 4: Models, Experimental Features, and Autopilot

Copilot CLI supports model switching and opt-in experimental capabilities for advanced workflows.

## Controls and Features

| Capability | Access Path |
|:-----------|:------------|
| model selection | `/model` command |
| experimental mode | `--experimental` or `/experimental` |
| autopilot mode | available in experimental feature set |

## Operator Guidance

- use default model for baseline reliability
- enable experimental mode in controlled environments first
- test autopilot on bounded tasks before enabling broader use

## Source References

- [Copilot CLI README: models and experimental mode](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/blob/main/README.md)
- [Copilot CLI changelog](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/blob/main/changelog.md)

## Summary

You can now tune Copilot CLI behavior for speed or control based on task risk.
