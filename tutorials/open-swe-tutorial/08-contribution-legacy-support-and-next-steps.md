# Chapter 8: Contribution, Legacy Support, and Next Steps

This chapter wraps with practical guidance for legacy stewardship and transition planning.

## Learning Goals

- contribute responsibly to a deprecated repository
- focus on docs, security, and critical-fix priorities
- preserve institutional knowledge during migration
- keep internal runbooks current and actionable

## Legacy Support Priorities

- prioritize security and operational stability fixes
- avoid broad architectural rewrites without ownership commitment
- document migration assumptions and owner responsibilities
- keep fork-specific changes isolated and auditable
