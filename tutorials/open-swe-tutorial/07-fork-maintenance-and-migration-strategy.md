# Chapter 7: Fork Maintenance and Migration Strategy

This chapter helps teams decide whether to maintain Open SWE forks or migrate away.

## Learning Goals

- evaluate technical debt and ownership costs
- define migration triggers and timeline
- keep legacy systems stable during transition
- choose target platforms for long-term maintainability

## Migration Strategy Template

1. audit critical dependencies and breakpoints
2. freeze risky feature expansion in legacy branch
3. run dual-track pilots on maintained alternatives
4. migrate workloads incrementally with rollback plans
