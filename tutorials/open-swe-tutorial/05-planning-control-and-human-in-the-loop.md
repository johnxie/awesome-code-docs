# Chapter 5: Planning Control and Human-in-the-Loop

This chapter focuses on plan-approval patterns and operator controls.

## Learning Goals

- use manual and auto label modes intentionally
- apply human checkpoints to reduce risky execution
- understand deprecated label variants and drift
- design safer intervention paths

## Control Patterns

- manual approval mode for sensitive changes
- auto mode for low-risk repetitive tasks
- real-time feedback loops during planning/execution
