# Chapter 1: Getting Started and Project Status

This chapter sets expectations for using a deprecated repository responsibly.

## Learning Goals

- confirm current maintenance status before adoption
- decide whether to study, fork, or migrate
- identify minimal setup paths for local evaluation
- avoid treating deprecated defaults as production-ready

## Status Assessment

Open SWE's README includes a deprecation notice. Treat the codebase primarily as a reference or controlled fork starting point unless you commit to ownership.

## Source References

- [Open SWE README](https://github.com/langchain-ai/open-swe/blob/main/README.md)
- [Open SWE Demo](https://swe.langchain.com)
- [Open SWE Docs Index File](https://github.com/langchain-ai/open-swe/blob/main/apps/docs/index.mdx)

## Summary

You now have the correct operating context for responsible Open SWE usage.
