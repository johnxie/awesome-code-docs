# Chapter 6: Files, Attachments, and Rich Data Flows

Fireproof supports richer document payloads through `_files` patterns and helper components like `ImgFile`.

## Rich Data Pattern

- store file objects in a document `_files` map
- persist metadata alongside attachments
- render media with Fireproof-aware UI components

## Example Use Cases

- profile images and asset galleries
- collaborative note attachments
- AI-generated media artifacts linked to document metadata

## Source References

- [Fireproof README: image workflows](https://github.com/fireproof-storage/fireproof/blob/main/README.md)
- [LLM docs bundle](https://use-fireproof.com/llms-full.txt)

## Summary

You now understand how to model and render rich media payloads in Fireproof documents.
