# Chapter 7: Development, Testing, and Contribution Workflow

This chapter focuses on contributor workflows in the monorepo.

## Learning Goals

- set up local tooling and pre-commit quality gates
- run server-level unit/integration tests reliably
- align docs updates with server changes
- prepare pull requests that satisfy repository standards

## Contribution Workflow

Adopt the repository pre-commit and test pipeline locally before opening PRs. Keep server changes, tests, and docs synchronized to reduce review churn.

## Source References

- [Contributing](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Summary

You now have a reliable workflow for shipping server changes in the `awslabs/mcp` ecosystem.
