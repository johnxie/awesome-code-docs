# Chapter 5: Data, Knowledge, and Agent Workflows

This chapter explains how documentation and data-oriented servers improve context quality for coding and operations agents.

## Learning Goals

- use documentation/knowledge servers to reduce stale-model assumptions
- combine data-oriented servers for richer troubleshooting and planning
- structure workflows that separate retrieval from action execution
- choose server combinations by task complexity and risk

## Workflow Pattern

Use knowledge and documentation servers first to build accurate context, then invoke mutating or operational servers only after intent and constraints are clear.

## Summary

You now have a context-first approach for data and knowledge enriched MCP workflows.
