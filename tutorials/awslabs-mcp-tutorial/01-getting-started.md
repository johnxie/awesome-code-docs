# Chapter 1: Getting Started

This chapter gives a practical first-run path through the AWS MCP ecosystem.

## Learning Goals

- identify one or two servers that match immediate needs
- configure installation for your primary MCP host client
- validate first tool calls with minimal environment risk
- establish baseline profiles and runtime settings

## Fast Start Loop

1. select an initial server (for example documentation, API, or IaC)
2. install via your MCP host pattern (`uvx`-based paths are common)
3. set minimal environment variables (region/profile/log level)
4. run a low-risk read-only query end to end
5. capture this configuration as your baseline template
