# Chapter 2: PRD Analysis & Task Generation

Welcome to **Chapter 2: PRD Analysis & Task Generation**. In this part of **Claude Task Master Tutorial: AI-Powered Task Management for Developers**, you will build an intuitive mental model first, then move into concrete implementation details and practical production tradeoffs.


Now that you have Task Master set up, let's dive into how it analyzes Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and generates actionable tasks. This is where Task Master truly shines - transforming high-level requirements into detailed, executable task lists.

## Understanding PRD Analysis

### What Makes a Good PRD?

Task Master works best with well-structured PRDs that include:

```markdown
# Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary
Brief overview of the product/feature

## Objectives
- Business objectives
- User goals
- Success metrics

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- User authentication
- Data storage
- API endpoints

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance requirements
- Security requirements
- Scalability needs

## User Stories
- As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]
- Acceptance criteria for each story

## Technical Considerations
- Technology stack
- Integration points
- Data architecture

## Timeline & Milestones
- Phase 1: MVP features
- Phase 2: Enhanced features
- Phase 3: Optimization
```

### PRD Analysis Process

Task Master uses AI to analyze your PRD through several stages:

## Best Practices for PRD Writing

### Structure Guidelines

```markdown
# PRD Title

## Executive Summary (1 paragraph)
What the product/feature does and why it matters

## Objectives & Success Metrics
- Business objectives with measurable outcomes
- User goals and success criteria
- Key performance indicators

## Requirements (Detailed but concise)
### Functional Requirements
- Must-have features with acceptance criteria
- Nice-to-have features clearly marked

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance requirements
- Security requirements
- Scalability requirements

## User Stories & Use Cases
- Primary user journeys
- Edge cases and error scenarios
- Integration points

## Technical Considerations
- Technology stack decisions
- Architecture constraints
- Integration requirements

## Timeline & Resources
- Realistic timeline with milestones
- Resource requirements
- Risk assessment and mitigation
```

### Common PRD Pitfalls to Avoid

```bash
# ❌ Too vague
"Build a user dashboard"

# ✅ Specific and measurable
"Build a user dashboard with real-time metrics, customizable widgets, and export functionality supporting PDF and CSV formats"
```

```bash
# ❌ Missing acceptance criteria
"User can log in"

# ✅ Clear acceptance criteria
"User can log in with email/password or OAuth providers. Login form validates input, shows clear error messages, and redirects to dashboard on success."
```

```bash
# Multi-user PRD review
task-master collaborative-analysis prd.md --team "alice,bob,charlie"

# Generate consensus tasks
task-master generate-consensus-tasks analysis-results.json

## What We've Accomplished

Congratulations! 🎉 You've learned how to:

1. **Write effective PRDs** that Task Master can analyze effectively
2. **Use Task Master's AI analysis** to break down complex requirements
3. **Generate detailed task lists** with dependencies and time estimates
4. **Apply industry-specific templates** for faster project setup
5. **Integrate with development tools** like GitHub, Jira, and Slack
6. **Refine and optimize** generated tasks based on project constraints
7. **Assess project risks** and create mitigation strategies
8. **Scale task management** for team collaboration

## Next Steps

Now that you understand how Task Master analyzes PRDs and generates tasks, let's explore how to manage and execute these tasks effectively. In [Chapter 3: Task Management & Execution](03-task-management.md), we'll dive into task lifecycle management, progress tracking, and team collaboration features.

**Practice what you've learned:**
1. Write a PRD for a project you're planning
2. Use Task Master to analyze it and generate tasks
3. Experiment with different templates and refinement options
4. Try integrating with your preferred development tools

*What's the most complex PRD you've written, and how could Task Master improve the process?* 📋

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Most teams struggle here because the hard part is not writing more code, but deciding clear boundaries for `task`, `master`, `tasks` so behavior stays predictable as complexity grows.

In practical terms, this chapter helps you avoid three common failures:

- coupling core logic too tightly to one implementation path
- missing the handoff boundaries between setup, execution, and validation
- shipping changes without clear rollback or observability strategy

After working through this chapter, you should be able to reason about `Chapter 2: PRD Analysis & Task Generation` as an operating subsystem inside **Claude Task Master Tutorial: AI-Powered Task Management for Developers**, with explicit contracts for inputs, state transitions, and outputs.

Use the implementation notes around `Week`, `user`, `Requirements` as your checklist when adapting these patterns to your own repository.

## How it Works Under the Hood

Under the hood, `Chapter 2: PRD Analysis & Task Generation` usually follows a repeatable control path:

1. **Context bootstrap**: initialize runtime config and prerequisites for `task`.
2. **Input normalization**: shape incoming data so `master` receives stable contracts.
3. **Core execution**: run the main logic branch and propagate intermediate state through `tasks`.
4. **Policy and safety checks**: enforce limits, auth scopes, and failure boundaries.
5. **Output composition**: return canonical result payloads for downstream consumers.
6. **Operational telemetry**: emit logs/metrics needed for debugging and performance tuning.

When debugging, walk this sequence in order and confirm each stage has explicit success/failure conditions.

## Source Walkthrough

Use the following upstream sources to verify implementation details while reading this chapter:

- [View Repo](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master)
  Why it matters: authoritative reference on `View Repo` (github.com).

Suggested trace strategy:
- search upstream code for `task` and `master` to map concrete implementation paths
- compare docs claims against actual runtime/config code before reusing patterns in production
