# Chapter 2: PRD Analysis & Task Generation

Now that you have Task Master set up, let's dive into how it analyzes Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and generates actionable tasks. This is where Task Master truly shines - transforming high-level requirements into detailed, executable task lists.

## Understanding PRD Analysis

### What Makes a Good PRD?

Task Master works best with well-structured PRDs that include:

```markdown
# Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary
Brief overview of the product/feature

## Objectives
- Business objectives
- User goals
- Success metrics

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- User authentication
- Data storage
- API endpoints

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance requirements
- Security requirements
- Scalability needs

## User Stories
- As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]
- Acceptance criteria for each story

## Technical Considerations
- Technology stack
- Integration points
- Data architecture

## Timeline & Milestones
- Phase 1: MVP features
- Phase 2: Enhanced features
- Phase 3: Optimization
```

### PRD Analysis Process

Task Master uses AI to analyze your PRD through several stages:

    C --> D[Dependency Analysis]
    D --> E[Complexity Assessment]

    F --> G[Timeline Estimation]
    G --> H[Priority Assignment]
    H --> I[Task Generation]
```

## Best Practices for PRD Writing

### Structure Guidelines

```markdown
# PRD Title

## Executive Summary (1 paragraph)
What the product/feature does and why it matters

## Objectives & Success Metrics
- Business objectives with measurable outcomes
- User goals and success criteria
- Key performance indicators

## Requirements (Detailed but concise)
### Functional Requirements
- Must-have features with acceptance criteria
- Nice-to-have features clearly marked

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance requirements
- Security requirements
- Scalability requirements

## User Stories & Use Cases
- Primary user journeys
- Edge cases and error scenarios
- Integration points

## Technical Considerations
- Technology stack decisions
- Architecture constraints
- Integration requirements

## Timeline & Resources
- Realistic timeline with milestones
- Resource requirements
- Risk assessment and mitigation
```

### Common PRD Pitfalls to Avoid

```bash
# ❌ Too vague
"Build a user dashboard"

# ✅ Specific and measurable
"Build a user dashboard with real-time metrics, customizable widgets, and export functionality supporting PDF and CSV formats"
```

```bash
# ❌ Missing acceptance criteria
"User can log in"

# ✅ Clear acceptance criteria
"User can log in with email/password or OAuth providers. Login form validates input, shows clear error messages, and redirects to dashboard on success."
```

## Advanced Task Master Features

### Collaborative PRD Analysis

```bash
# Multi-user PRD review
task-master collaborative-analysis prd.md --team "alice,bob,charlie"

# Generate consensus tasks
task-master generate-consensus-tasks analysis-results.json
```

### Iterative Refinement

```bash
# Refine tasks based on feedback
task-master refine-tasks tasks.json --feedback "add-mobile-support"

# Update PRD and regenerate
task-master update-prd prd.md --changes "new-requirements.md"
task-master regenerate-tasks updated-prd.md
```

### Project Templates

```bash
# Use proven project templates
task-master create-from-template "ecommerce-platform" --customize

# Available templates:
# - web-application
# - mobile-app
# - api-platform
# - data-pipeline
