## Installation Options

### Option 1: MCP Integration (Recommended)

MCP (Model Control Protocol) provides the most seamless integration with your editor:

#### For Cursor
```bash
# Add to your MCP configuration
# ~/.cursor/mcp.json or .cursor/mcp.json in project
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "task-master-ai": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "--package=task-master-ai", "task-master-ai"],
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "your-anthropic-key",
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your-openai-key",
        "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "your-perplexity-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### For Windsurf
```bash
# Add to your Windsurf MCP configuration
# ~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "task-master-ai": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "--package=task-master-ai", "task-master-ai"],
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "your-anthropic-key",
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your-openai-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### For VS Code
```bash
# Add to your VS Code MCP configuration
# .vscode/mcp.json in project
{
  "servers": {
    "task-master-ai": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "--package=task-master-ai", "task-master-ai"],
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "your-anthropic-key"
      },
      "type": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Local Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g task-master-ai

# Or install locally in your project
npm install task-master-ai

# Verify installation
task-master --version
```

## Your First Project Setup

Let's create your first AI-managed project:

### Step 1: Initialize Task Master

```bash
# Initialize in your project directory
cd your-project-directory
task-master init

# Or use with MCP (recommended)
# In your editor's AI chat, type:
# "Initialize taskmaster-ai in my project"
```

### Step 2: Create a Project Requirements Document (PRD)

Task Master works best with a detailed PRD. Create `.taskmaster/docs/prd.txt`:

```txt
# E-commerce Platform PRD

## Overview
Build a modern e-commerce platform with the following features:
- User authentication and profiles
- Product catalog with search and filtering
- Shopping cart and checkout system
- Order management and tracking
- Admin dashboard for inventory management

## Technical Requirements
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: JWT tokens
- Payment: Stripe integration

## Target Users
- End customers looking for products
- Business owners managing their store
- Administrators overseeing the platform

## Success Metrics
- Support 1000+ concurrent users
- Process payments securely
- Maintain 99.9% uptime
- Complete orders within 24 hours

## Timeline
- MVP: 3 months
- Full launch: 6 months
```

### Step 3: Parse Your Requirements

```bash
# Parse the PRD and generate tasks
task-master parse-prd .taskmaster/docs/prd.txt

# Or use MCP command in your editor:
# "Can you parse my PRD at .taskmaster/docs/prd.txt?"
```

### Step 4: Review Generated Tasks

```bash
# List all generated tasks
task-master list

# View specific tasks
task-master show 1,2,3

# Or use MCP:
# "Can you show me tasks 1, 2, and 3?"
```

## Understanding Task Master Architecture

### Core Components

```
Task Master System
├── AI Engine (Claude/OpenAI/GPT)
├── Task Parser (PRD → Tasks)
├── Task Manager (CRUD operations)
├── Dependency Resolver (Task relationships)
├── Progress Tracker (Completion monitoring)
└── Editor Integration (MCP/WebSocket)
```

### Task Structure

Each task contains:
- **ID**: Unique identifier
- **Title**: Clear, actionable description
- **Description**: Detailed requirements and context
- **Dependencies**: Tasks that must be completed first
- **Priority**: High, Medium, Low
- **Estimated Time**: Time estimate in hours
- **Status**: Pending, In Progress, Completed, Blocked
- **Assigned To**: Team member or AI agent

### Task Dependencies

```json
{
  "task_1": {
    "title": "Set up project structure",
    "dependencies": [],
    "estimated_hours": 2,
    "status": "completed"
  },
  "task_2": {
    "title": "Implement user authentication",
    "dependencies": ["task_1"],
    "estimated_hours": 8,
    "status": "in_progress"
  },
  "task_3": {
    "title": "Create user profile pages",
    "dependencies": ["task_2"],
    "estimated_hours": 6,
    "status": "pending"
  }
}
```

## Working with Tasks

### Basic Task Operations

```bash
# Start working on a task
task-master start 2

# Mark task as completed
task-master complete 2

# Update task description
task-master update 2 --description "New description"

# Add time spent
task-master log 2 --hours 3

# Or use MCP commands:
# "Can you start working on task 2?"
# "Mark task 2 as completed"
```

### Task Filtering and Search

```bash
# Show only pending tasks
task-master list --status pending

# Show high priority tasks
task-master list --priority high

# Search tasks by keyword
task-master search "authentication"

# Show tasks assigned to you
task-master list --assigned-to me
```

### Dependency Management

```bash
# Add dependency between tasks
task-master dependency add 5 --depends-on 2,3

# Remove dependency
task-master dependency remove 5 --depends-on 2

# View task dependencies
task-master show 5 --dependencies

# Show dependency graph
task-master graph
```

## AI-Powered Features

### Intelligent Task Breakdown

Task Master uses AI to:
- **Analyze Complexity**: Determine task difficulty and time estimates
- **Identify Dependencies**: Automatically detect task relationships
- **Suggest Prioritization**: Recommend task execution order
- **Generate Descriptions**: Create detailed task descriptions
- **Estimate Time**: Provide realistic time estimates

### Smart Suggestions

```bash
# Get next recommended task
task-master next

# Get suggestions for current task
task-master suggest 2

# Analyze project progress
task-master analyze

# Or use MCP:
# "What's the next task I should work on?"
# "Can you suggest improvements for task 2?"
```

### Research Integration

```bash
# Research specific technologies
task-master research "React best practices for e-commerce"

# Research implementation approaches
task-master research "JWT authentication patterns"

# Get fresh information for current task
task-master research --task 3 "payment integration security"

# Or use MCP:
# "Research the latest best practices for implementing JWT authentication"
```

## Multi-Model Support

Task Master supports multiple AI models for different purposes:

### Main Model (Claude/OpenAI)
- Task planning and breakdown
- Code generation and review
- Architecture decisions

### Research Model (Perplexity/OpenAI)
- Information gathering
- Technology research
- Best practices lookup

### Fallback Model
- Backup when primary models are unavailable
- Cost-effective task management

```bash
# Configure different models
task-master config --main-model claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
task-master config --research-model gpt-4o
task-master config --fallback-model gpt-3.5-turbo
```
