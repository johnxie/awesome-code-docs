# Chapter 8: Contribution Workflow and Governance

This chapter covers contribution expectations and governance norms for sustainable ecosystem growth.

## Learning Goals

- align contributions with issue-first collaboration
- understand priority and ownership expectations
- prepare high-quality PRs with tests and docs
- improve contributor velocity while reducing maintainer load

## Contribution Workflow

1. find or open an issue before larger feature work
2. align scope and direction with maintainers
3. develop with clear module boundaries and validation
4. submit PRs with documentation and verification evidence

## Governance Priorities

- production reliability over novelty
- deterministic behavior and transparent operations
- reusable skills over one-off prompt artifacts
- clear docs and onboarding for community contributors

## Summary

You now have an end-to-end operating model for deploying, integrating, and contributing to Refly.

Next steps:

- run one full workflow via API and webhook to compare behavior
- export and test one skill in your Claude Code environment
- contribute one focused improvement with docs and validation notes
