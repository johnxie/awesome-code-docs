# Chapter 1: Getting Started

Welcome to **Chapter 1: Getting Started**. In this part of **Refly Tutorial: Build Deterministic Agent Skills and Ship Them Across APIs and Claude Code**, you will build an intuitive mental model first, then move into concrete implementation details and practical production tradeoffs.


This chapter establishes a local Refly baseline for experimentation and integration.

## Learning Goals

- install runtime prerequisites for local development
- run middleware and application services
- verify baseline web/API availability
- identify fastest path for first workflow execution

## Local Dev Bootstrap

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker/docker-compose.middleware.yml -p refly up -d
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm copy-env:develop
pnpm build
pnpm dev
```

## First Validation Checklist

- middleware containers are healthy
- web app is reachable at `http://localhost:5173`
- API responds after startup
- you can create and run a simple workflow

## Source References

## Summary

You now have a baseline local environment for running Refly workflows.

Next: [Chapter 2: Architecture and Component Topology](02-architecture-and-component-topology.md)

## Depth Expansion Playbook

<!-- depth-expansion-v2 -->

This chapter is expanded to v1-style depth for production-grade learning and implementation quality.

### Strategic Context

- tutorial: **Refly Tutorial: Build Deterministic Agent Skills and Ship Them Across APIs and Claude Code**
- tutorial slug: **refly-tutorial**
- chapter focus: **Chapter 1: Getting Started**
- system context: **Refly Tutorial**
- objective: move from surface-level usage to repeatable engineering operation

### Architecture Decomposition

1. Define the runtime boundary for `Chapter 1: Getting Started`.
2. Separate control-plane decisions from data-plane execution.
3. Capture input contracts, transformation points, and output contracts.
4. Trace state transitions across request lifecycle stages.
5. Identify extension hooks and policy interception points.
6. Map ownership boundaries for team and automation workflows.
7. Specify rollback and recovery paths for unsafe changes.
8. Track observability signals for correctness, latency, and cost.

### Operator Decision Matrix

| Decision Area | Low-Risk Path | High-Control Path | Tradeoff |
|:--------------|:--------------|:------------------|:---------|
| Runtime mode | managed defaults | explicit policy config | speed vs control |
| State handling | local ephemeral | durable persisted state | simplicity vs auditability |
| Tool integration | direct API use | mediated adapter layer | velocity vs governance |
| Rollout method | manual change | staged + canary rollout | effort vs safety |
| Incident response | best effort logs | runbooks + SLO alerts | cost vs reliability |

### Failure Modes and Countermeasures

| Failure Mode | Early Signal | Root Cause Pattern | Countermeasure |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------------|:---------------|
| stale context | inconsistent outputs | missing refresh window | enforce context TTL and refresh hooks |
| policy drift | unexpected execution | ad hoc overrides | centralize policy profiles |
| auth mismatch | 401/403 bursts | credential sprawl | rotation schedule + scope minimization |
| schema breakage | parser/validation errors | unmanaged upstream changes | contract tests per release |
| retry storms | queue congestion | no backoff controls | jittered backoff + circuit breakers |
| silent regressions | quality drop without alerts | weak baseline metrics | eval harness with thresholds |

### Implementation Runbook

1. Establish a reproducible baseline environment.
2. Capture chapter-specific success criteria before changes.
3. Implement minimal viable path with explicit interfaces.
4. Add observability before expanding feature scope.
5. Run deterministic tests for happy-path behavior.
6. Inject failure scenarios for negative-path validation.
7. Compare output quality against baseline snapshots.
8. Promote through staged environments with rollback gates.
9. Record operational lessons in release notes.

### Advanced Practice Exercises

1. Build a minimal end-to-end implementation for `Chapter 1: Getting Started`.
2. Add instrumentation and measure baseline latency and error rate.
3. Introduce one controlled failure and confirm graceful recovery.
4. Add policy constraints and verify they are enforced consistently.
5. Run a staged rollout and document rollback decision criteria.

2. What signal detects regressions earliest in your environment?
3. What tradeoff did you make between delivery speed and governance?
4. How would you recover from the highest-impact failure mode?
5. What must be automated before scaling to team-wide adoption?

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Most teams struggle here because the hard part is not writing more code, but deciding clear boundaries for `pnpm`, `docker`, `compose` so behavior stays predictable as complexity grows.

In practical terms, this chapter helps you avoid three common failures:

- coupling core logic too tightly to one implementation path
- missing the handoff boundaries between setup, execution, and validation
- shipping changes without clear rollback or observability strategy

After working through this chapter, you should be able to reason about `Chapter 1: Getting Started` as an operating subsystem inside **Refly Tutorial: Build Deterministic Agent Skills and Ship Them Across APIs and Claude Code**, with explicit contracts for inputs, state transitions, and outputs.

Use the implementation notes around `deploy`, `middleware`, `refly` as your checklist when adapting these patterns to your own repository.

## How it Works Under the Hood

Under the hood, `Chapter 1: Getting Started` usually follows a repeatable control path:

1. **Context bootstrap**: initialize runtime config and prerequisites for `pnpm`.
2. **Input normalization**: shape incoming data so `docker` receives stable contracts.
3. **Core execution**: run the main logic branch and propagate intermediate state through `compose`.
4. **Policy and safety checks**: enforce limits, auth scopes, and failure boundaries.
5. **Output composition**: return canonical result payloads for downstream consumers.
6. **Operational telemetry**: emit logs/metrics needed for debugging and performance tuning.

When debugging, walk this sequence in order and confirm each stage has explicit success/failure conditions.
