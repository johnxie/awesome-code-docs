# Chapter 1: Getting Started and Scaffolding Flow

This chapter covers first-run setup for new TypeScript MCP server projects.

## Learning Goals

- generate a project with `npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server`
- understand scaffold command options and naming inputs
- run initial install/build cycle successfully
- establish reproducible onboarding instructions

## Quick Start

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server my-server
```

Then run `npm install`, `npm run build`, and optionally `npm run watch` for iterative development.

## Source References

- [Create TypeScript Server README](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/create-typescript-server/blob/main/README.md)

## Summary

You now have a reliable baseline for generating TypeScript MCP servers.
