# Chapter 7: Quality, Security, and Contribution Practices

This chapter covers governance guardrails for generated-project ecosystems.

## Learning Goals

- align contribution workflows with upstream standards
- incorporate security reporting and response procedures
- define internal quality gates for scaffold-derived code
- maintain reviewability as generated code diverges from template defaults

## Source References

- [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/create-typescript-server/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Security Policy](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/create-typescript-server/blob/main/SECURITY.md)

## Summary

You now have a governance baseline for secure and maintainable scaffold-derived projects.
