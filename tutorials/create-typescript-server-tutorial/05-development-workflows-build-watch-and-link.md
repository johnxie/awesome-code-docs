# Chapter 5: Development Workflows: Build, Watch, and Link

This chapter covers practical day-to-day development loops.

## Learning Goals

- use build/watch modes for rapid iteration
- link local binaries for integration testing
- structure scripts and environment setup for team consistency
- reduce iteration friction across development environments

## Core Workflow

1. `npm run build` for one-shot compile
2. `npm run watch` for iterative development
3. `npm link` when local command exposure is useful

## Source References

- [Create TypeScript Server README](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/create-typescript-server/blob/main/README.md)
- [Template README - Development](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/create-typescript-server/blob/main/template/README.md.ejs#development)

## Summary

You now have a repeatable development loop for generated server projects.
