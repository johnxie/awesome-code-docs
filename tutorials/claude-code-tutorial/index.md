## Why This Track Matters

Claude Code is one of the highest-usage terminal coding agents. To use it effectively in real repositories, teams need clear control patterns for edits, commands, and tooling.

This track focuses on:

- deterministic task loops in terminal workflows
- safe file-edit and command approval patterns
- git-native review and rollback behavior
- extension through MCP and advanced automation
