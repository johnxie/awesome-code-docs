# Chapter 7: Profiles and Team Standards

Team adoption depends on shared profiles and operating conventions.

## Team Profile Components

- default model/provider strategy
- mode usage rules by task type
- command and tool allowlists
- coding and review standards

## Standardization Benefits

| Standard | Outcome |
|:---------|:--------|
| shared prompt patterns | more consistent results |
| common validation commands | easier CI alignment |
| policy versioning | safer rollout and rollback |

## Rollout Pattern

1. start with a pilot profile
2. measure quality/cost outcomes
3. refine and publish team baseline
4. expand to more repositories

## Summary

You can now deploy Roo Code with predictable team-wide behavior and quality controls.
