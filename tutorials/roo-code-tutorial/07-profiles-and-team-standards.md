# Chapter 7: Profiles and Team Standards

Profiles are the mechanism for scaling Roo Code behavior consistently across teams.

## Profile Baseline

| Component | Standardize |
|:----------|:------------|
| model strategy | default model tiers by task class |
| mode policy | which mode is allowed for which work |
| tool policy | allowlist and approval thresholds |
| output format | required summary and evidence template |

## Rollout Sequence

1. pilot profile in one repository
2. measure quality, latency, and cost outcomes
3. revise policy and publish versioned baseline
4. expand to additional repos with opt-in gates

## Operational Benefits

- more predictable task quality
- easier onboarding and review
- lower variance in cost and execution time

## Summary

You can now deploy Roo Code with shared operating standards instead of ad hoc usage.
