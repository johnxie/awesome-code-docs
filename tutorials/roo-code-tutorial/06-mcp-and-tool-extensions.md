# Chapter 6: MCP and Tool Extensions

MCP tool integration extends Roo Code into domain-specific workflows.

## MCP Extension Workflow

1. connect or register an MCP server
2. inspect tool contracts
3. validate call/response behavior
4. gate mutating tools via explicit approvals

## Tool Contract Guidelines

- strict schema validation
- deterministic error responses
- side-effect classification
- timeout and retry limits

## Common High-Value Tools

- issue tracker integration
- cloud infra operations
- internal docs/knowledge retrieval
- deployment/environment status queries

## Summary

You can now design MCP integrations that are powerful but still governable.
