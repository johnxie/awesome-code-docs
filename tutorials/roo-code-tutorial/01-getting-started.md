# Chapter 1: Getting Started

This chapter gets Roo Code installed and validated in an editor development loop.

## Setup Path

1. install Roo Code from supported marketplace/install method
2. configure provider credentials/profile
3. open a sandbox repository
4. run a small bounded task with review enabled

## First Validation Task

Use a low-risk task combining analysis + edit + verification:

- summarize module structure
- apply a tiny refactor
- run lint or one test command

This confirms end-to-end toolchain behavior.

## Safety Baseline

Keep approvals active for command and edit operations while calibrating your profile and mode defaults.

## Summary

You now have a functioning Roo Code setup and baseline for deeper mode-driven workflows.
