# Chapter 1: Getting Started

This chapter gets Roo Code installed and validated in a safe editor workflow.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Purpose |
|:------------|:--------|
| VS Code-compatible editor | Roo Code extension runtime |
| provider credentials | enables model-backed task execution |
| test repository | low-risk place to calibrate behavior |

## Setup Sequence

1. install Roo Code from the supported marketplace path
2. configure provider and profile defaults
3. open a sandbox project with stable tests
4. run a bounded first task with approvals enabled

## First Validation Prompt

```text
Summarize module structure, refactor one utility function,
run the repository lint command, and report changed files.
```

## First-Run Success Criteria

- file reads and summaries are accurate
- edit proposals are reviewable before apply
- command output is captured clearly
- final summary maps edits to validation results

## Summary

You now have Roo Code running with a controlled baseline for deeper mode-driven workflows.
