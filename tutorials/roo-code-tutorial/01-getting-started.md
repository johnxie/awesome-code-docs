# Chapter 1: Getting Started

Welcome to **Chapter 1: Getting Started**. In this part of **Roo Code Tutorial: Run an AI Dev Team in Your Editor**, you will build an intuitive mental model first, then move into concrete implementation details and practical production tradeoffs.


This chapter establishes a stable Roo Code baseline in a VS Code-compatible workflow.

## Objectives

By the end, you will have:

1. Roo Code installed and running
2. one provider configured successfully
3. a deterministic first task completed
4. a minimum approval policy for safe usage

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Why It Matters |
|:------------|:---------------|
| VS Code-compatible editor | Roo Code extension runtime |
| API credentials for at least one provider | model-backed execution |
| sandbox repository | low-risk calibration environment |
| canonical lint/test command | repeatable validation signal |

## Installation Paths

### Marketplace install

Install Roo Code from the VS Code marketplace and reload the editor.

### VSIX install (team/internal path)

Roo Code repository docs include VSIX build/install flows.

Typical dev workflow commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code.git
cd Roo-Code
pnpm install
pnpm install:vsix
```

Alternative manual VSIX flow:

```bash
pnpm vsix
code --install-extension bin/roo-cline-<version>.vsix
```

## Provider Setup

Start with one known-good provider/model pair. Add more only after first task reliability is proven.

Initial policy:

- approvals enabled for file edits and commands
- no broad automation modes during first-day onboarding
- explicit task summaries required

## First Task Prompt

```text
Analyze src/services/session.ts,
refactor one function for readability without changing behavior,
run the target test command,
and summarize changed files and validation output.
```

Success criteria:

- proposed patch is reviewable
- expected file scope is respected
- command output is captured
- summary maps changes to results

## Baseline Safety Defaults

Set and document:

- default mode for routine coding tasks
- approval threshold for mutating commands
- required validation command for each task class
- rollback expectation for risky changes

## First-Run Checklist

| Area | Check | Pass Signal |
|:-----|:------|:------------|
| Install | extension loads correctly | Roo interface opens without errors |
| Provider | model call succeeds | initial task response is actionable |
| Edit flow | diffs are visible before apply | review step works consistently |
| Command flow | test/lint command executes | output attached to task result |
| Summary | results are clear and complete | reviewer can understand outcome quickly |

## Common Startup Issues

### Provider mismatch

- confirm selected provider and key are aligned
- reduce to one provider first

### Unstable task outputs

- tighten task scope to one file/module
- include explicit non-goals
- require final summary format

### Command confusion

- specify exact command in prompt
- avoid ambiguous phrasing like "run checks"

## Chapter Summary

You now have Roo Code running with:

- installation complete
- provider baseline validated
- deterministic first task executed
- initial safety policy in place

Next: [Chapter 2: Modes and Task Design](02-modes-and-task-design.md)

## Depth Expansion Playbook

<!-- depth-expansion-v2 -->

This chapter is expanded to v1-style depth for production-grade learning and implementation quality.

### Strategic Context

- tutorial: **Roo Code Tutorial: Run an AI Dev Team in Your Editor**
- tutorial slug: **roo-code-tutorial**
- chapter focus: **Chapter 1: Getting Started**
- system context: **Roo Code Tutorial**
- objective: move from surface-level usage to repeatable engineering operation

### Architecture Decomposition

1. Define the runtime boundary for `Chapter 1: Getting Started`.
2. Separate control-plane decisions from data-plane execution.
3. Capture input contracts, transformation points, and output contracts.
4. Trace state transitions across request lifecycle stages.
5. Identify extension hooks and policy interception points.
6. Map ownership boundaries for team and automation workflows.
7. Specify rollback and recovery paths for unsafe changes.
8. Track observability signals for correctness, latency, and cost.

### Operator Decision Matrix

| Decision Area | Low-Risk Path | High-Control Path | Tradeoff |
|:--------------|:--------------|:------------------|:---------|
| Runtime mode | managed defaults | explicit policy config | speed vs control |
| State handling | local ephemeral | durable persisted state | simplicity vs auditability |
| Tool integration | direct API use | mediated adapter layer | velocity vs governance |
| Rollout method | manual change | staged + canary rollout | effort vs safety |
| Incident response | best effort logs | runbooks + SLO alerts | cost vs reliability |

### Failure Modes and Countermeasures

| Failure Mode | Early Signal | Root Cause Pattern | Countermeasure |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------------|:---------------|
| stale context | inconsistent outputs | missing refresh window | enforce context TTL and refresh hooks |
| policy drift | unexpected execution | ad hoc overrides | centralize policy profiles |
| auth mismatch | 401/403 bursts | credential sprawl | rotation schedule + scope minimization |
| schema breakage | parser/validation errors | unmanaged upstream changes | contract tests per release |
| retry storms | queue congestion | no backoff controls | jittered backoff + circuit breakers |
| silent regressions | quality drop without alerts | weak baseline metrics | eval harness with thresholds |

### Implementation Runbook

1. Establish a reproducible baseline environment.
2. Capture chapter-specific success criteria before changes.
3. Implement minimal viable path with explicit interfaces.
4. Add observability before expanding feature scope.
5. Run deterministic tests for happy-path behavior.
6. Inject failure scenarios for negative-path validation.
7. Compare output quality against baseline snapshots.
8. Promote through staged environments with rollback gates.
9. Record operational lessons in release notes.

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Most teams struggle here because the hard part is not writing more code, but deciding clear boundaries for `pnpm`, `install`, `vsix` so behavior stays predictable as complexity grows.

In practical terms, this chapter helps you avoid three common failures:

- coupling core logic too tightly to one implementation path
- missing the handoff boundaries between setup, execution, and validation
- shipping changes without clear rollback or observability strategy

After working through this chapter, you should be able to reason about `Chapter 1: Getting Started` as an operating subsystem inside **Roo Code Tutorial: Run an AI Dev Team in Your Editor**, with explicit contracts for inputs, state transitions, and outputs.

Use the implementation notes around `Code`, `clone`, `https` as your checklist when adapting these patterns to your own repository.

## How it Works Under the Hood

Under the hood, `Chapter 1: Getting Started` usually follows a repeatable control path:

1. **Context bootstrap**: initialize runtime config and prerequisites for `pnpm`.
2. **Input normalization**: shape incoming data so `install` receives stable contracts.
3. **Core execution**: run the main logic branch and propagate intermediate state through `vsix`.
4. **Policy and safety checks**: enforce limits, auth scopes, and failure boundaries.
5. **Output composition**: return canonical result payloads for downstream consumers.
6. **Operational telemetry**: emit logs/metrics needed for debugging and performance tuning.

When debugging, walk this sequence in order and confirm each stage has explicit success/failure conditions.

## Source Walkthrough

Use the following upstream sources to verify implementation details while reading this chapter:

- [Roo Code README](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/blob/main/README.md)
  Why it matters: authoritative reference on `Roo Code README` (github.com).
- [Roo Code Docs](https://docs.roocode.com/)
  Why it matters: authoritative reference on `Roo Code Docs` (docs.roocode.com).
- [Using Modes docs page](https://docs.roocode.com/basic-usage/using-modes)
  Why it matters: authoritative reference on `Using Modes docs page` (docs.roocode.com).
- [Roo Code Releases](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/releases)
  Why it matters: authoritative reference on `Roo Code Releases` (github.com).

Suggested trace strategy:
- search upstream code for `pnpm` and `install` to map concrete implementation paths
- compare docs claims against actual runtime/config code before reusing patterns in production
