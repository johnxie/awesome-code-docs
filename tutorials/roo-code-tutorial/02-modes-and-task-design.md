# Chapter 2: Modes and Task Design

Welcome to **Chapter 2: Modes and Task Design**. In this part of **Roo Code Tutorial: Run an AI Dev Team in Your Editor**, you will build an intuitive mental model first, then move into concrete implementation details and practical production tradeoffs.


Roo Code's mode system is its core quality-control mechanism. This chapter shows how to choose and sequence modes deliberately.

## Mode Landscape

Roo documentation and project materials cover modes including:

- Code
- Ask
- Architect
- Debug
- Orchestrator
- Custom modes (team-specific)

## Mode Selection Matrix

| Mode | Best For | Avoid Using It For |
|:-----|:---------|:-------------------|
| Ask | quick understanding and codebase questions | large multi-file implementation |
| Architect | decomposition, design proposals, migration planning | immediate low-level patching |
| Code | implementation and scoped refactors | broad strategy decisions |
| Debug | reproduction and root-cause loops | greenfield architecture |
| Orchestrator | coordinating multi-step tasks | low-complexity one-file edits |
| Custom | team/domain workflows | unvalidated generic tasks |

## Mode Transition Pattern

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Ask or Architect] --> B[Plan Approved]
    B --> C[Code Mode Execution]
    C --> D{Failure?}
    D -- Yes --> E[Debug Mode]
    E --> C
    D -- No --> F[Finalize and Summarize]
```

This prevents premature implementation.

## Task Contract Template

Use the same structure in every mode:

```text
Goal:
Mode:
Allowed files:
Forbidden changes:
Validation command:
Definition of done:
```

Mode selection should be explicit in the prompt.

## Designing Custom Modes

Use custom modes when you need repeated domain behavior such as:

- backend API triage
- migration planning
- documentation enforcement
- release note synthesis

Custom mode quality improves when you define:

- narrow responsibilities
- required output format
- prohibited actions
- mandatory validation steps

## Common Mode Anti-Patterns

- using Code mode for unresolved architecture tasks
- running Debug mode without reproducible failing evidence
- switching modes mid-task without preserving constraints
- one custom mode trying to do everything

## Team Mode Policy

Define a simple team policy table:

| Task Class | Allowed Mode(s) | Required Validation |
|:-----------|:----------------|:--------------------|
| bugfix | Debug -> Code | failing + passing test |
| feature | Architect -> Code | unit + integration check |
| refactor | Code | regression-focused tests |
| doc updates | Ask/Custom | link and formatting checks |

This reduces random mode usage.

## Chapter Summary

You now have a mode-driven execution framework that supports:

- deliberate mode choice
- safer transitions between planning and implementation
- reusable custom-mode behavior for teams

## Depth Expansion Playbook

<!-- depth-expansion-v2 -->

This chapter is expanded to v1-style depth for production-grade learning and implementation quality.

### Strategic Context

- tutorial: **Roo Code Tutorial: Run an AI Dev Team in Your Editor**
- tutorial slug: **roo-code-tutorial**
- chapter focus: **Chapter 2: Modes and Task Design**
- system context: **Roo Code Tutorial**
- objective: move from surface-level usage to repeatable engineering operation

### Architecture Decomposition

1. Define the runtime boundary for `Chapter 2: Modes and Task Design`.
2. Separate control-plane decisions from data-plane execution.
3. Capture input contracts, transformation points, and output contracts.
4. Trace state transitions across request lifecycle stages.
5. Identify extension hooks and policy interception points.
6. Map ownership boundaries for team and automation workflows.
7. Specify rollback and recovery paths for unsafe changes.
8. Track observability signals for correctness, latency, and cost.

### Operator Decision Matrix

| Decision Area | Low-Risk Path | High-Control Path | Tradeoff |
|:--------------|:--------------|:------------------|:---------|
| Runtime mode | managed defaults | explicit policy config | speed vs control |
| State handling | local ephemeral | durable persisted state | simplicity vs auditability |
| Tool integration | direct API use | mediated adapter layer | velocity vs governance |
| Rollout method | manual change | staged + canary rollout | effort vs safety |
| Incident response | best effort logs | runbooks + SLO alerts | cost vs reliability |

### Failure Modes and Countermeasures

| Failure Mode | Early Signal | Root Cause Pattern | Countermeasure |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------------|:---------------|
| stale context | inconsistent outputs | missing refresh window | enforce context TTL and refresh hooks |
| policy drift | unexpected execution | ad hoc overrides | centralize policy profiles |
| auth mismatch | 401/403 bursts | credential sprawl | rotation schedule + scope minimization |
| schema breakage | parser/validation errors | unmanaged upstream changes | contract tests per release |
| retry storms | queue congestion | no backoff controls | jittered backoff + circuit breakers |
| silent regressions | quality drop without alerts | weak baseline metrics | eval harness with thresholds |

### Implementation Runbook

1. Establish a reproducible baseline environment.
2. Capture chapter-specific success criteria before changes.
3. Implement minimal viable path with explicit interfaces.
4. Add observability before expanding feature scope.
5. Run deterministic tests for happy-path behavior.
6. Inject failure scenarios for negative-path validation.
7. Compare output quality against baseline snapshots.
8. Promote through staged environments with rollback gates.
9. Record operational lessons in release notes.

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Most teams struggle here because the hard part is not writing more code, but deciding clear boundaries for `Mode`, `flowchart`, `Architect` so behavior stays predictable as complexity grows.

In practical terms, this chapter helps you avoid three common failures:

- coupling core logic too tightly to one implementation path
- missing the handoff boundaries between setup, execution, and validation
- shipping changes without clear rollback or observability strategy

After working through this chapter, you should be able to reason about `Chapter 2: Modes and Task Design` as an operating subsystem inside **Roo Code Tutorial: Run an AI Dev Team in Your Editor**, with explicit contracts for inputs, state transitions, and outputs.

Use the implementation notes around `Plan`, `Approved`, `Code` as your checklist when adapting these patterns to your own repository.

## How it Works Under the Hood

Under the hood, `Chapter 2: Modes and Task Design` usually follows a repeatable control path:

1. **Context bootstrap**: initialize runtime config and prerequisites for `Mode`.
2. **Input normalization**: shape incoming data so `flowchart` receives stable contracts.
3. **Core execution**: run the main logic branch and propagate intermediate state through `Architect`.
4. **Policy and safety checks**: enforce limits, auth scopes, and failure boundaries.
5. **Output composition**: return canonical result payloads for downstream consumers.
6. **Operational telemetry**: emit logs/metrics needed for debugging and performance tuning.

When debugging, walk this sequence in order and confirm each stage has explicit success/failure conditions.

## Source Walkthrough

Use the following upstream sources to verify implementation details while reading this chapter:

- [Roo Code README](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/blob/main/README.md)
  Why it matters: authoritative reference on `Roo Code README` (github.com).
- [Roo Code Docs](https://docs.roocode.com/)
  Why it matters: authoritative reference on `Roo Code Docs` (docs.roocode.com).
- [Using Modes docs page](https://docs.roocode.com/basic-usage/using-modes)
  Why it matters: authoritative reference on `Using Modes docs page` (docs.roocode.com).
- [Roo Code Releases](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/releases)
  Why it matters: authoritative reference on `Roo Code Releases` (github.com).

Suggested trace strategy:
- search upstream code for `Mode` and `flowchart` to map concrete implementation paths
- compare docs claims against actual runtime/config code before reusing patterns in production
