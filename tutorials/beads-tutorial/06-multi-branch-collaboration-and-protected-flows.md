# Chapter 6: Multi-Branch Collaboration and Protected Flows

This chapter covers contributor/maintainer collaboration and protected branch operations.

## Learning Goals

- use contributor mode in forked workflows
- operate maintainers' protected branch settings safely
- avoid merge-state corruption in multi-branch coordination
- preserve planning continuity across branches

## Collaboration Controls

- contributor mode for planning separation
- maintainer role detection and explicit overrides
- protected branch sync patterns for safer integration

## Source References

- [Beads README Contributor vs Maintainer](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads/blob/main/README.md)
- [Protected Branches Guide](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads/blob/main/docs/PROTECTED_BRANCHES.md)

## Summary

You now have safer collaboration patterns for branch-heavy Beads workflows.
