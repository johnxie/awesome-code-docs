# Chapter 4: Dependency Graph and Hierarchy Patterns

This chapter focuses on modeling blocker relationships and hierarchical plans.

## Learning Goals

- represent parent/child and blocking relationships correctly
- use hierarchy IDs for epic decomposition
- avoid cyclic dependencies in planning graphs
- improve ready-task signal quality

## Pattern Guidance

- reserve hierarchy for delivery decomposition
- use relation links for cross-cutting context
- keep dependencies minimal and explicit

## Source References

- [Beads README Hierarchy & Workflow](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads/blob/main/README.md)
- [Beads FAQ](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads/blob/main/docs/FAQ.md)

## Summary

You now can model complex plans as clean, navigable Beads graphs.
