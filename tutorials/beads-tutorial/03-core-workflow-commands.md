# Chapter 3: Core Workflow Commands

This chapter covers daily command patterns for execution flow.

## Learning Goals

- run `ready`, `create`, `update`, and `show` loops
- claim and progress tasks safely
- keep issue state synchronized with real work
- reduce accidental task duplication

## Command Rhythm

- use `bd ready` for next actionable tasks
- use `bd update --claim` for ownership handoff
- use `bd show` to inspect full context and history

## Source References

- [Beads Troubleshooting](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads/blob/main/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
