# LlamaIndex Tutorial: Building Advanced RAG Systems and Data Frameworks

> This tutorial is AI-generated! To learn more, check out [Awesome Code Docs](https://github.com/johnxie/awesome-code-docs)

LlamaIndex<sup>[View Repo](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index)</sup> (formerly GPT Index) is a comprehensive data framework for connecting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external data sources. It provides powerful tools for ingestion, indexing, querying, and deployment of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems with enterprise-grade performance and reliability.

LlamaIndex enables you to build sophisticated AI applications that can reason over private data, maintain context across conversations, and provide accurate, up-to-date responses based on your specific knowledge base.
