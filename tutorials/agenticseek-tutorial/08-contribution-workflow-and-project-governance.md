# Chapter 8: Contribution Workflow and Project Governance

This chapter explains how to contribute effectively while preserving local-first architecture goals.

## Learning Goals

- follow the project's contribution flow from branch to PR
- align new work with privacy-first and modular-agent principles
- contribute new tools and agents without destabilizing routing
- improve docs/tests while keeping operator trust high

## Contribution Workflow

1. Fork and create a focused branch.
2. Implement one coherent improvement per PR.
3. Validate runtime behavior locally.
4. Submit PR with clear context and expected behavior changes.

## Project Governance Principles

From the project contribution guidance, prioritize:

- local-first privacy guarantees
- modular agent architecture with single responsibilities
- tool-level extensibility and testability
- graceful failure handling with meaningful feedback

## High-Impact Contribution Areas

- routing quality and agent-selection improvements
- browser/tool reliability hardening
- cross-platform startup experience and install ergonomics
- docs and troubleshooting clarity improvements
