# Chapter 2: Architecture and Routing System

Welcome to **Chapter 2: Architecture and Routing System**. In this part of **AgenticSeek Tutorial: Local-First Autonomous Agent Operations**, you will build an intuitive mental model first, then move into concrete implementation details and practical production tradeoffs.


This chapter explains how AgenticSeek decomposes tasks across planner and specialist agents.

## Learning Goals

- map the high-level component boundaries
- understand how routing chooses specialist agents
- identify where prompts, tools, and execution loops live
- reason about failure domains across routing and execution

## System Components

Core directories to understand first:

- `llm_router/`: routing and model dispatch utilities
- `sources/agents/`: specialist agents (`planner`, `browser`, `code`, `file`, `mcp`, `casual`)
- `sources/tools/`: executable capabilities invoked by agent tool blocks
- `prompts/`: prompt templates (`base` and `jarvis` variants)
- `frontend/` + backend entrypoints: user interaction and orchestration surface

## Routing Mental Model

```mermaid

    A[User request] --> B[Routing decision]
    B --> C[Planner agent]
    C --> D[Specialist agent selection]
    D --> E[Tool block generation]
    E --> F[Tool execution]
    F --> G[Answer + reasoning]
```

## Why This Matters Operationally

- planner quality directly affects downstream execution quality
- explicit user intents reduce wrong-agent assignment risk
- tool-block parsing is a critical control point for deterministic execution

## Architecture Review Checklist

- verify which agent class owns each new behavior
- keep tool scope narrow and single-purpose
- update related prompt templates when adding tools
- test routing behavior on at least three intent categories

## Summary

You now understand where routing, agent logic, and tool execution boundaries sit.

## Depth Expansion Playbook

<!-- depth-expansion-v2 -->

This chapter is expanded to v1-style depth for production-grade learning and implementation quality.

### Strategic Context

- tutorial: **AgenticSeek Tutorial: Local-First Autonomous Agent Operations**
- tutorial slug: **agenticseek-tutorial**
- chapter focus: **Chapter 2: Architecture and Routing System**
- system context: **Agenticseek Tutorial**
- objective: move from surface-level usage to repeatable engineering operation

### Architecture Decomposition

1. Define the runtime boundary for `Chapter 2: Architecture and Routing System`.
2. Separate control-plane decisions from data-plane execution.
3. Capture input contracts, transformation points, and output contracts.
4. Trace state transitions across request lifecycle stages.
5. Identify extension hooks and policy interception points.
6. Map ownership boundaries for team and automation workflows.
7. Specify rollback and recovery paths for unsafe changes.
8. Track observability signals for correctness, latency, and cost.

### Operator Decision Matrix

| Decision Area | Low-Risk Path | High-Control Path | Tradeoff |
|:--------------|:--------------|:------------------|:---------|
| Runtime mode | managed defaults | explicit policy config | speed vs control |
| State handling | local ephemeral | durable persisted state | simplicity vs auditability |
| Tool integration | direct API use | mediated adapter layer | velocity vs governance |
| Rollout method | manual change | staged + canary rollout | effort vs safety |
| Incident response | best effort logs | runbooks + SLO alerts | cost vs reliability |

### Failure Modes and Countermeasures

| Failure Mode | Early Signal | Root Cause Pattern | Countermeasure |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------------|:---------------|
| stale context | inconsistent outputs | missing refresh window | enforce context TTL and refresh hooks |
| policy drift | unexpected execution | ad hoc overrides | centralize policy profiles |
| auth mismatch | 401/403 bursts | credential sprawl | rotation schedule + scope minimization |
| schema breakage | parser/validation errors | unmanaged upstream changes | contract tests per release |
| retry storms | queue congestion | no backoff controls | jittered backoff + circuit breakers |
| silent regressions | quality drop without alerts | weak baseline metrics | eval harness with thresholds |

### Implementation Runbook

1. Establish a reproducible baseline environment.
2. Capture chapter-specific success criteria before changes.
3. Implement minimal viable path with explicit interfaces.
4. Add observability before expanding feature scope.
5. Run deterministic tests for happy-path behavior.
6. Inject failure scenarios for negative-path validation.
7. Compare output quality against baseline snapshots.
8. Promote through staged environments with rollback gates.
9. Record operational lessons in release notes.

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Most teams struggle here because the hard part is not writing more code, but deciding clear boundaries for `agent`, `Tool`, `flowchart` so behavior stays predictable as complexity grows.

In practical terms, this chapter helps you avoid three common failures:

- coupling core logic too tightly to one implementation path
- missing the handoff boundaries between setup, execution, and validation
- shipping changes without clear rollback or observability strategy

After working through this chapter, you should be able to reason about `Chapter 2: Architecture and Routing System` as an operating subsystem inside **AgenticSeek Tutorial: Local-First Autonomous Agent Operations**, with explicit contracts for inputs, state transitions, and outputs.

Use the implementation notes around `User`, `request`, `Routing` as your checklist when adapting these patterns to your own repository.

## How it Works Under the Hood

Under the hood, `Chapter 2: Architecture and Routing System` usually follows a repeatable control path:

1. **Context bootstrap**: initialize runtime config and prerequisites for `agent`.
2. **Input normalization**: shape incoming data so `Tool` receives stable contracts.
3. **Core execution**: run the main logic branch and propagate intermediate state through `flowchart`.
4. **Policy and safety checks**: enforce limits, auth scopes, and failure boundaries.
5. **Output composition**: return canonical result payloads for downstream consumers.
6. **Operational telemetry**: emit logs/metrics needed for debugging and performance tuning.

When debugging, walk this sequence in order and confirm each stage has explicit success/failure conditions.
