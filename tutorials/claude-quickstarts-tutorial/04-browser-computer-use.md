# Chapter 4: Browser and Computer Use

Automation quickstarts demonstrate how Claude can execute browser and desktop actions.

## Browser Automation Pattern

- navigate page
- inspect DOM state
- perform targeted interactions
- verify outcome with assertions/screenshots

## Safety Controls

- strict allowlist of domains/actions
- confirmation step for destructive operations
- timeout and retry policies for flaky pages

## Computer Use Notes

Computer control workflows are powerful but require strong human-in-the-loop controls for production.

## Summary

You can now apply Claude to UI automation with explicit safety boundaries.
