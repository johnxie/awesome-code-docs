# Chapter 6: Production Patterns

This chapter consolidates production lessons across all quickstarts.

## Reliability Baseline

- retries with bounded backoff
- timeout budgets by endpoint
- circuit breakers for dependencies

## Security Baseline

- scoped API keys and secret rotation
- strict tool allowlists
- PII redaction in logs and traces

## Observability Baseline

- request IDs in every response
- latency + error metrics by feature
- quality evaluation datasets for regression detection

## Final Summary

You now have a practical framework for moving Claude quickstart prototypes into production.
