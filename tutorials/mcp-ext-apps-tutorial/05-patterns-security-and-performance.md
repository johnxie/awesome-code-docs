# Chapter 5: Patterns, Security, and Performance

This chapter consolidates practical patterns for robust MCP Apps UX and operations.

## Learning Goals

- apply recommended patterns for large data, latency, and error handling
- configure CSP/CORS and theming safely across hosts
- implement progressive enhancement without sacrificing reliability
- prevent common performance bottlenecks in embedded app views

## Pattern Areas

| Area | Pattern Focus |
|:-----|:--------------|
| data flow | chunked tool calls and structured follow-up messages |
| UX | progressive rendering and latency reduction tactics |
| security | CSP/CORS boundaries and safe resource delivery |
| runtime | pausing offscreen-heavy views and state persistence |

## Summary

You now have a practical pattern library for secure, performant MCP Apps.
