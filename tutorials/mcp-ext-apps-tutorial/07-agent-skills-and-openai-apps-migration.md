# Chapter 7: Agent Skills and OpenAI Apps Migration

This chapter focuses on adoption accelerators and migration planning.

## Learning Goals

- install and use agent skills to scaffold MCP Apps workflows
- map OpenAI Apps concepts to MCP Apps equivalents
- identify unsupported areas and migration caveats early
- plan phased migration for existing app ecosystems

## Migration Checklist

1. compare server-side metadata and method mappings
2. port client-side context and tool call patterns
3. audit unsupported features and design fallback behavior
4. validate side-by-side behavior before full cutover
