# Chapter 1: Getting Started and Spec Orientation

This chapter introduces MCP Apps scope and the quickest path to first execution.

## Learning Goals

- understand how MCP Apps extends core MCP capabilities
- install the SDK and identify app-side vs host-side packages
- align on stable spec versioning and compatibility expectations
- run a minimal quickstart loop

## Setup Baseline

```bash
npm install -S @modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps
```

Add `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps/react` if you are building React-based app UIs.
