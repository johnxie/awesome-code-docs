## Why This Track Matters

Browser Use is a leading open-source framework for LLM-driven browser control. Teams use it to automate real-world web workflows that static APIs cannot cover.

This track focuses on:

- building robust browser agents that can reason over page state
- handling navigation, interaction, extraction, and multi-step tasks
- integrating Browser Use into larger coding-agent and operations pipelines
- deploying reliable automations with observability and safeguards
