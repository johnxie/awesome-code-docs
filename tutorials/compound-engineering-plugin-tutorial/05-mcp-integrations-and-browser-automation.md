# Chapter 5: MCP Integrations and Browser Automation

This chapter explains how MCP-backed capabilities and browser automation expand workflow reach.

## Learning Goals

- integrate and validate MCP servers used by compound workflows
- understand how Context7 and Playwright support common tasks
- apply browser automation with safe operational defaults
- diagnose MCP connectivity issues quickly

## Integration Model

The plugin ecosystem supports MCP tools for:

- documentation and context retrieval
- browser-driven validation and testing
- external service integration in workflow commands

## Safety Guidelines

- validate MCP server credentials and permissions before execution
- run browser automation in non-critical targets first
- keep explicit logs for automation actions in team workflows
