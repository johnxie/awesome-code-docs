# Chapter 2: Compound Engineering Philosophy and Workflow Loop

This chapter explains the project's core premise: each work cycle should improve future cycles.

## Learning Goals

- understand the plan-work-review-compound loop deeply
- map philosophy to daily engineering decisions
- separate workflow discipline from tool-specific implementation details
- avoid anti-patterns that erase compounding benefits

## Workflow Core

```text
Plan -> Work -> Review -> Compound -> Repeat
```

## Compounding Principles

- invest heavily in planning and review quality
- capture reusable patterns and pitfalls after each cycle
- feed learnings back into future planning and execution

## Common Anti-Patterns

- skipping review phase under schedule pressure
- treating compound step as optional documentation overhead
- scaling scope before baseline workflow reliability is proven

## Summary

You now understand how the workflow loop creates durable engineering leverage.
