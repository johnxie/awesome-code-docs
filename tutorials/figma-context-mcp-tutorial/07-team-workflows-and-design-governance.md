# Chapter 7: Team Workflows and Design Governance

Teams need standardized patterns for design-to-code workflows to avoid inconsistent outputs.

## Governance Pattern

1. define approved prompt templates
2. enforce component library and token alignment
3. require diff review against design requirements
4. track recurring mismatch classes and fix root causes

## Summary

You now have a team governance baseline for consistent design-to-code execution.
