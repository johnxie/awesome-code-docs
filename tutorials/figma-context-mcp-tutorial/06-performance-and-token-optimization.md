# Chapter 6: Performance and Token Optimization

Performance improves when context payloads are scoped and prompts are structured for deterministic outputs.

## Optimization Levers

| Lever | Effect |
|:------|:-------|
| tighter frame scope | lower payload size |
| explicit output requirements | fewer retries |
| staged generation | reduced error propagation |

## Summary

You now have token and latency controls for efficient design-to-code workflows.
