# Chapter 4: Prompt Patterns for One-Shot UI Implementation

Prompt quality is the multiplier for design context quality.

## High-Value Prompt Structure

1. include frame URL and target framework
2. request semantic component decomposition
3. specify responsive behavior and constraints
4. require accessibility and design token alignment

## Common Prompt Mistakes

- asking for full app generation from entire file root
- omitting framework or styling constraints
- ignoring spacing, typography, and state variants

## Summary

You now have prompt patterns that convert design context into higher-fidelity code output.
