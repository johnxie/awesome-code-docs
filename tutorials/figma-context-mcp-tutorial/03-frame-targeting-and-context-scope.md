# Chapter 3: Frame Targeting and Context Scope

Accurate implementation depends on precise frame selection and scoped context extraction.

## Scope Rules

| Rule | Benefit |
|:-----|:--------|
| target specific frame/group URLs | avoids over-broad context |
| split large designs into segments | improves determinism |
| align scope with component boundaries | cleaner generated structure |

## Summary

You now have practical scoping techniques that improve one-shot implementation quality.
