# Chapter 3: Photo Management

This chapter covers importing, organizing, and managing your photo collection in PhotoPrism.

## 📥 Importing Photos

### Batch Import

```bash
# Copy photos to import directory
cp ~/new-photos/*.jpg ~/photoprism/photos/import/

# Trigger import
docker exec photoprism photoprism import

# Or use web interface
# Library > Import > Select files
```

### Import Options

```typescript
// Import configuration
const importOptions = {
  moveFiles: true,        // Move vs copy files
  deleteAfterImport: false, // Delete originals
  skipDuplicates: true,   // Skip existing files
  createAlbums: true,     // Auto-create albums
  indexOnly: false        // Index without moving
}
```

## 📁 Organization

### Folder Structure

```bash
# Recommended organization
photos/
├── originals/           # Original files
├── import/             # New photos to import
├── 2023/
│   ├── 01-january/
│   │   ├── vacation/
│   │   ├── family/
│   │   └── events/
│   └── 02-february/
