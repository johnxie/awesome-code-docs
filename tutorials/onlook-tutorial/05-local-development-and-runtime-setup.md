# Chapter 5: Local Development and Runtime Setup

This chapter covers local development setup for contributors and advanced operators.

## Learning Goals

- install local prerequisites for Onlook development
- bootstrap and run the monorepo runtime
- prepare database and environment dependencies
- establish repeatable local development workflows

## Prerequisites (Docs References)

Onlook development docs reference key dependencies including:

- Bun
- Docker
- Node.js
- Codesandbox account/keys and model provider keys for certain flows

## Common Development Commands

From the developer docs flow:

```bash
bun dev
```

Additional setup in the docs includes database migration/seed commands for local environments.

## Local Ops Checklist

1. clone repo and install dependencies
2. configure required environment variables
3. run database setup commands (if needed)
4. start dev server
5. open local URL and validate editor startup

## Source References

- [Onlook Running Locally](https://docs.onlook.com/developers/running-locally)

## Summary

You now have a repeatable foundation for local Onlook development.
