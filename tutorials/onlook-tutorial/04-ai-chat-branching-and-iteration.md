# Chapter 4: AI Chat, Branching, and Iteration

This chapter covers prompt-driven workflows and branch-first experimentation in Onlook.

## Learning Goals

- use AI chat prompts with bounded task scope
- combine prompt edits with manual visual refinement
- use branch/checkpoint workflows to limit risk
- converge faster on production-ready UI outcomes

## Prompt Strategy Baseline

1. start with concise intent + explicit target page/component
2. request one change class at a time (layout, typography, interaction)
3. review generated code after each prompt batch
4. checkpoint/branch before broad UI rewrites

## Iteration Loop

- prompt for draft changes
- inspect visual output
- correct with direct visual edits
- validate code diff and behavior
- commit to branch

## Source References

- [Onlook README](https://github.com/onlook-dev/onlook/blob/main/README.md)
- [Onlook Docs](https://docs.onlook.com)

## Summary

You now have a practical pattern for controlled, high-speed AI-assisted UI iteration.
