# Chapter 6: Dashboards & Insights

Communicate analytics with curated dashboards and saved insights.

## Objectives
- Build dashboards for teams
- Create saved insights (funnels, retention, trends)
- Schedule reports and alerts

## Dashboard Patterns
- **Executive**: ARR, activation, churn, NPS
- **Product**: Core funnel, feature adoption, retention
- **Growth**: Acquisition, campaigns, referral metrics

## Saved Insights
- Funnels: conversion of onboarding
- Trends: DAU/WAU/MAU; active vs. returning users
- Retention: week-over-week returning users
- Paths: common drop-offs after key events

## Scheduling & Alerts
- Email/Slack digests for key dashboards
- Anomaly detection alerts on core metrics

## Troubleshooting
- Stale data: confirm ingestion; check timezone alignment
- Slow dashboards: reduce date ranges; limit breakdowns

## Performance Notes
- Prefer focused dashboards with <15 insights
- Use filters and breakdowns sparingly on large datasets

## Security/Privacy
- Limit dashboard sharing; sanitize PII in visuals

## Next Steps
Chapter 7 dives into advanced analytics: cohorts, SQL insights, and data warehouse sync.
