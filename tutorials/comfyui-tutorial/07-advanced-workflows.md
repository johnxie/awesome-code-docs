# Chapter 7: Advanced Workflows & Automation

Create complex, automated generation pipelines with advanced ComfyUI workflows. Learn batch processing, conditional logic, and multi-stage refinement techniques.

## Batch Processing

### Automated Batch Generation

```javascript
// Batch processing setup
const batchWorkflow = {
  batch_size: 10,
  variations: 5,
  output_directory: "./batch_output"
};
```

### Queue Management

```javascript
// Workflow queue system
const queueManager = {
  pending: [],
  processing: [],
  completed: [],
  failed: []
};
```

## Conditional Workflows

### Logic-Based Branching

```javascript
// Conditional execution
const conditionalWorkflow = {
  condition: "input_quality > 0.8",
  true_branch: "enhancement_workflow",
  false_branch: "regeneration_workflow"
};
```

## Multi-Stage Pipelines

### Iterative Refinement

```javascript
// Multi-stage generation
const multiStage = {
  stages: [
    { name: "draft", quality: "fast" },
    { name: "refine", quality: "standard" },
    { name: "final", quality: "premium" }
  ]
};
```

## Next Steps
