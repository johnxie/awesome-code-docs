# Chapter 8: Production & Optimization

Optimize ComfyUI for production use with performance tuning, resource management, and scalable deployment strategies.

## Performance Optimization

### Hardware Acceleration

```javascript
// GPU optimization settings
const gpuOptimization = {
  precision: "fp16",
  attention: "xformers",
  vae: "tiling_enabled",
  memory: "optimized"
};
```

### Memory Management

```javascript
// Memory optimization techniques
const memoryOptimization = {
  model_unloading: true,
  cache_management: "aggressive",
  batch_processing: true
};
```

## Production Deployment

### Server Setup

```javascript
// Production server configuration
const productionConfig = {
  gpu: "A100",
  memory: "80GB",
  storage: "2TB NVMe",
  network: "10Gbps"
};
```

### API Integration

```javascript
// REST API for ComfyUI
const apiIntegration = {
  endpoints: ["/generate", "/status", "/queue"],
  authentication: "JWT",
  rate_limiting: "100 requests/minute"
};
```

## Scaling Strategies

### Distributed Processing

```javascript
// Multi-GPU setup
const distributedSetup = {
  nodes: 4,
  gpus_per_node: 2,
  load_balancer: "nginx",
  queue_system: "redis"
};
```

### Batch Processing

```javascript
// Large-scale batch generation
const batchProcessing = {
  queue_size: 1000,
  parallel_workers: 8,
  error_handling: "retry_with_backoff",
  monitoring: "prometheus"
};
```

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Performance Monitoring

```javascript
// Production monitoring
const monitoring = {
  metrics: ["generation_time", "memory_usage", "gpu_utilization"],
  alerts: ["queue_full", "high_memory", "gpu_overload"],
  logging: "structured_json"
};
```
