# LiteLLM Tutorial: Unified LLM Gateway and Routing Layer

> Build provider-agnostic LLM applications with `BerriAI/litellm`, including routing, fallbacks, proxy deployment, and cost-aware operations.

## Why This Track Matters

As teams add more models/providers, integration and reliability complexity grows quickly. LiteLLM is often used as the control plane for that complexity.

This track focuses on:

- one interface across many model providers
- resilient fallback and retry strategies
- cost and latency observability
- proxy-mode operations for team and production usage
