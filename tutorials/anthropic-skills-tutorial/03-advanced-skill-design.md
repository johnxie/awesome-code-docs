# Chapter 3: Advanced Skill Design

Welcome to **Chapter 3: Advanced Skill Design**. In this part of **Anthropic Skills Tutorial: Reusable AI Agent Capabilities**, you will build an intuitive mental model first, then move into concrete implementation details and practical production tradeoffs.


Advanced skills are small systems. Treat them like mini-products with explicit interfaces.

## Multi-File Skill Layout

```text
customer-support-skill/
  SKILL.md
  scripts/
    classify_ticket.py
    enrich_account_context.ts
  references/
    escalation-policy.md
    sla-tiers.md
  assets/
    issue-taxonomy.csv
  templates/
    escalation-email.md
```

## Progressive Disclosure Pattern

Good skills avoid dumping all context at once. Instead:

1. Start with task intent and output contract.
2. Pull references only when relevant.
3. Call scripts only when deterministic transformation is required.

This pattern reduces token waste and improves instruction adherence.

## Frontmatter and Metadata Strategy

At minimum, keep `name` and `description` precise.

For larger catalogs, add optional metadata fields (when your runtime supports them) to improve discoverability and policy checks, such as:

- compatibility constraints
- license information
- ownership metadata
- tool allowlists

## Script Design Rules

Scripts should be boring and reliable.

- Use strict argument parsing.
- Return stable JSON structures.
- Fail loudly with actionable error messages.
- Avoid hidden network side effects unless clearly documented.

Example output contract:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "severity": "high",
  "routing_queue": "support-l2",
  "confidence": 0.91
}
```

## References and Assets

- Put durable, high-signal guidance in `references/`.
- Keep `assets/` for files that are required but not convenient to inline.
- Version both in Git so skill behavior is auditable over time.

## Maintainability Checklist

- Single responsibility per script
- Explicit file paths in instructions
- Backward-compatible schema evolution
- Changelog entries for instruction changes

## Summary

You can now design skills that remain understandable as they grow beyond a single markdown file.

Next: [Chapter 4: Integration Platforms](04-integration-platforms.md)

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Most teams struggle here because the hard part is not writing more code, but deciding clear boundaries for `support`, `escalation`, `customer` so behavior stays predictable as complexity grows.

In practical terms, this chapter helps you avoid three common failures:

- coupling core logic too tightly to one implementation path
- missing the handoff boundaries between setup, execution, and validation
- shipping changes without clear rollback or observability strategy

After working through this chapter, you should be able to reason about `Chapter 3: Advanced Skill Design` as an operating subsystem inside **Anthropic Skills Tutorial: Reusable AI Agent Capabilities**, with explicit contracts for inputs, state transitions, and outputs.

Use the implementation notes around `skill`, `SKILL`, `scripts` as your checklist when adapting these patterns to your own repository.

## How it Works Under the Hood

Under the hood, `Chapter 3: Advanced Skill Design` usually follows a repeatable control path:

1. **Context bootstrap**: initialize runtime config and prerequisites for `support`.
2. **Input normalization**: shape incoming data so `escalation` receives stable contracts.
3. **Core execution**: run the main logic branch and propagate intermediate state through `customer`.
4. **Policy and safety checks**: enforce limits, auth scopes, and failure boundaries.
5. **Output composition**: return canonical result payloads for downstream consumers.
6. **Operational telemetry**: emit logs/metrics needed for debugging and performance tuning.

When debugging, walk this sequence in order and confirm each stage has explicit success/failure conditions.

## Source Walkthrough

Use the following upstream sources to verify implementation details while reading this chapter:

- [anthropics/skills repository](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)
  Why it matters: authoritative reference on `anthropics/skills repository` (github.com).

Suggested trace strategy:
- search upstream code for `support` and `escalation` to map concrete implementation paths
- compare docs claims against actual runtime/config code before reusing patterns in production

## Depth Expansion Playbook

This chapter is expanded to v1-style depth for production-grade learning and implementation quality.

### Strategic Context

- tutorial: **Anthropic Skills Tutorial: Reusable AI Agent Capabilities**
- tutorial slug: **anthropic-skills-tutorial**
- chapter focus: **Chapter 3: Advanced Skill Design**
- system context: **Anthropic Skills Tutorial**
- objective: move from surface-level usage to repeatable engineering operation

### Architecture Decomposition

1. Define the runtime boundary for `Chapter 3: Advanced Skill Design`.
2. Separate control-plane decisions from data-plane execution.
3. Capture input contracts, transformation points, and output contracts.
4. Trace state transitions across request lifecycle stages.
5. Identify extension hooks and policy interception points.
6. Map ownership boundaries for team and automation workflows.
7. Specify rollback and recovery paths for unsafe changes.
8. Track observability signals for correctness, latency, and cost.

### Operator Decision Matrix

| Decision Area | Low-Risk Path | High-Control Path | Tradeoff |
|:--------------|:--------------|:------------------|:---------|
| Runtime mode | managed defaults | explicit policy config | speed vs control |
| State handling | local ephemeral | durable persisted state | simplicity vs auditability |
| Tool integration | direct API use | mediated adapter layer | velocity vs governance |
| Rollout method | manual change | staged + canary rollout | effort vs safety |
| Incident response | best effort logs | runbooks + SLO alerts | cost vs reliability |

### Failure Modes and Countermeasures

| Failure Mode | Early Signal | Root Cause Pattern | Countermeasure |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------------|:---------------|
| stale context | inconsistent outputs | missing refresh window | enforce context TTL and refresh hooks |
| policy drift | unexpected execution | ad hoc overrides | centralize policy profiles |
| auth mismatch | 401/403 bursts | credential sprawl | rotation schedule + scope minimization |
| schema breakage | parser/validation errors | unmanaged upstream changes | contract tests per release |
| retry storms | queue congestion | no backoff controls | jittered backoff + circuit breakers |
| silent regressions | quality drop without alerts | weak baseline metrics | eval harness with thresholds |

### Implementation Runbook

1. Establish a reproducible baseline environment.
2. Capture chapter-specific success criteria before changes.
3. Implement minimal viable path with explicit interfaces.
4. Add observability before expanding feature scope.
5. Run deterministic tests for happy-path behavior.
6. Inject failure scenarios for negative-path validation.
7. Compare output quality against baseline snapshots.
8. Promote through staged environments with rollback gates.
9. Record operational lessons in release notes.
