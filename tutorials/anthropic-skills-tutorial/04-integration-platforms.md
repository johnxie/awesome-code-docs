# Chapter 4: Integration Platforms

Welcome to **Chapter 4: Integration Platforms**. In this part of **Anthropic Skills Tutorial: Reusable AI Agent Capabilities**, you will build an intuitive mental model first, then move into concrete implementation details and practical production tradeoffs.


The same skill package can be used across multiple surfaces, but deployment and governance expectations differ.

## Claude Code

Claude Code is strong for engineering and file-centric workflows.

From the official skills repository, a common setup is:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add anthropics/skills
/plugin install example-skills@anthropic-agent-skills
```

Operational guidance:

- Keep skill repos versioned and pinned.
- Prefer local scripts for deterministic steps.
- Enforce repository-level review on `SKILL.md` changes.

## Claude.ai

Claude.ai is ideal for interactive drafting and team collaboration.

Use it when:

- humans need to iterate on outputs quickly
- file upload context is part of the workflow
- you want lower-friction skill adoption for non-engineers

Guardrail recommendation: keep a canonical output template in the skill so generated artifacts remain comparable.

## Claude API

API integration gives maximal control for enterprise systems.

Typical pattern:

1. Load skill instructions as controlled context.
2. Inject request-specific payload.
3. Validate output against schema.
4. Store run metadata for auditing.

Pseudo-flow:

```text
request -> select skill -> build prompt context -> generate -> validate -> persist
```

## Cross-Platform Compatibility Strategy

| Concern | Claude Code | Claude.ai | Claude API |
|:--------|:------------|:----------|:-----------|
| Local file/scripts | Strong | Limited | App-controlled |
| Governance controls | Git + review | Workspace policies | Full policy engine |
| Structured validation | Medium | Medium | Strong |
| Automation depth | High | Medium | Highest |

## Integration Pitfalls

- Reusing one skill unchanged across radically different environments
- Assuming runtime-specific tools exist everywhere
- Failing to log skill version with each generated artifact

## Summary

You can now choose the right runtime surface and adjust operating controls per platform.

Next: [Chapter 5: Production Skills](05-production-skills.md)

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Most teams struggle here because the hard part is not writing more code, but deciding clear boundaries for `skills`, `plugin`, `marketplace` so behavior stays predictable as complexity grows.

In practical terms, this chapter helps you avoid three common failures:

- coupling core logic too tightly to one implementation path
- missing the handoff boundaries between setup, execution, and validation
- shipping changes without clear rollback or observability strategy

After working through this chapter, you should be able to reason about `Chapter 4: Integration Platforms` as an operating subsystem inside **Anthropic Skills Tutorial: Reusable AI Agent Capabilities**, with explicit contracts for inputs, state transitions, and outputs.

Use the implementation notes around `anthropics`, `install`, `example` as your checklist when adapting these patterns to your own repository.

## How it Works Under the Hood

Under the hood, `Chapter 4: Integration Platforms` usually follows a repeatable control path:

1. **Context bootstrap**: initialize runtime config and prerequisites for `skills`.
2. **Input normalization**: shape incoming data so `plugin` receives stable contracts.
3. **Core execution**: run the main logic branch and propagate intermediate state through `marketplace`.
4. **Policy and safety checks**: enforce limits, auth scopes, and failure boundaries.
5. **Output composition**: return canonical result payloads for downstream consumers.
6. **Operational telemetry**: emit logs/metrics needed for debugging and performance tuning.

When debugging, walk this sequence in order and confirm each stage has explicit success/failure conditions.

## Source Walkthrough

Use the following upstream sources to verify implementation details while reading this chapter:

- [anthropics/skills repository](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)
  Why it matters: authoritative reference on `anthropics/skills repository` (github.com).

Suggested trace strategy:
- search upstream code for `skills` and `plugin` to map concrete implementation paths
- compare docs claims against actual runtime/config code before reusing patterns in production

### Strategic Context

- tutorial: **Anthropic Skills Tutorial: Reusable AI Agent Capabilities**
- tutorial slug: **anthropic-skills-tutorial**
- chapter focus: **Chapter 4: Integration Platforms**
- system context: **Anthropic Skills Tutorial**
- objective: move from surface-level usage to repeatable engineering operation

### Architecture Decomposition

1. Define the runtime boundary for `Chapter 4: Integration Platforms`.
2. Separate control-plane decisions from data-plane execution.
3. Capture input contracts, transformation points, and output contracts.
4. Trace state transitions across request lifecycle stages.
5. Identify extension hooks and policy interception points.
6. Map ownership boundaries for team and automation workflows.
7. Specify rollback and recovery paths for unsafe changes.
8. Track observability signals for correctness, latency, and cost.

### Operator Decision Matrix

| Decision Area | Low-Risk Path | High-Control Path | Tradeoff |
|:--------------|:--------------|:------------------|:---------|
| Runtime mode | managed defaults | explicit policy config | speed vs control |
| State handling | local ephemeral | durable persisted state | simplicity vs auditability |
| Tool integration | direct API use | mediated adapter layer | velocity vs governance |
| Rollout method | manual change | staged + canary rollout | effort vs safety |
| Incident response | best effort logs | runbooks + SLO alerts | cost vs reliability |

### Failure Modes and Countermeasures

| Failure Mode | Early Signal | Root Cause Pattern | Countermeasure |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------------|:---------------|
| stale context | inconsistent outputs | missing refresh window | enforce context TTL and refresh hooks |
| policy drift | unexpected execution | ad hoc overrides | centralize policy profiles |
| auth mismatch | 401/403 bursts | credential sprawl | rotation schedule + scope minimization |
| schema breakage | parser/validation errors | unmanaged upstream changes | contract tests per release |
| retry storms | queue congestion | no backoff controls | jittered backoff + circuit breakers |
| silent regressions | quality drop without alerts | weak baseline metrics | eval harness with thresholds |

### Implementation Runbook

1. Establish a reproducible baseline environment.
2. Capture chapter-specific success criteria before changes.
3. Implement minimal viable path with explicit interfaces.
4. Add observability before expanding feature scope.
5. Run deterministic tests for happy-path behavior.
6. Inject failure scenarios for negative-path validation.
7. Compare output quality against baseline snapshots.
8. Promote through staged environments with rollback gates.
9. Record operational lessons in release notes.
