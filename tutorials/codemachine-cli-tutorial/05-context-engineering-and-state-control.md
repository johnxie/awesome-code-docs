# Chapter 5: Context Engineering and State Control

Context engineering in CodeMachine determines what each agent sees at each workflow step.

## Controls

| Control | Purpose |
|:--------|:--------|
| scoped context injection | reduce noise and drift |
| dynamic state updates | preserve workflow continuity |
| context reset points | avoid stale accumulation |

## Summary

You now have context controls for maintaining workflow quality across long runs.
