# Chapter 8: Production Operations and Governance

Production Kilo adoption requires clear policy around auth, approvals, extension usage, and rollout controls.

## Governance Checklist

1. standardize provider/auth onboarding for all users
2. define allowed auto-approval conditions
3. review extension/MCP additions before team-wide rollout
4. pin versions and test release upgrades
5. monitor session behavior and failures through support logs
