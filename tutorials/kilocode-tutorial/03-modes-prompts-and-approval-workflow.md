# Chapter 3: Modes, Prompts, and Approval Workflow

Kilo supports different run modes and approval paths that balance autonomy with safety.

## Practical Controls

- mode selection (code/architect/debug variants)
- non-interactive auto-approval mode where appropriate
- ask routing for commands, tools, and followup decisions

## Source References

- [CLI usage in apps/cli README](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/blob/main/apps/cli/README.md)
- [Ask dispatcher and prompt manager](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/tree/main/apps/cli/src/agent)

## Summary

You now have a mode-selection and approval strategy for safer Kilo sessions.
