# Chapter 8: Testing, Operations, and Contribution Workflows

This chapter closes with an operations model for sustained C# SDK usage.

## Learning Goals

- align test strategy with SDK and protocol risk surfaces
- run docs/build/test workflows expected by maintainers
- structure contributions for quick and accurate review
- operationalize incidents and improvement loops around MCP services

## Operations Baseline

- run full repository tests before upgrading package dependencies
- validate docs and sample paths that your teams rely on
- maintain service playbooks for auth, transport, and task workflows
- upstream reproducible bugs with minimal examples and protocol context

## Summary

You now have a practical operations and contribution framework for long-term C# MCP execution.
