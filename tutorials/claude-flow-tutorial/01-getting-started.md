# Chapter 1: Getting Started

This chapter gets Claude Flow running quickly and sets expectations for how it should be used.

## Learning Goals

- install and initialize Claude Flow CLI paths
- understand project positioning around orchestration versus execution
- validate first swarm and memory commands
- establish a safe baseline before scaling complexity

## First-Run Baseline

1. ensure Node.js 18+ (V2) or Node.js 20+ (V3 docs) for the selected flow
2. initialize with `npx claude-flow@alpha init --wizard` or equivalent install path
3. run basic swarm setup and status checks
4. test one memory store/search loop
5. pair with your coding host while keeping execution responsibility explicit in your workflow

## Summary

You now have a practical bootstrap path and a clearer operating model for early adoption.
