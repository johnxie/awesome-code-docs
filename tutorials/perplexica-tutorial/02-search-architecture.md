# Chapter 2: Search Engine Architecture

Understanding Perplexica's architecture is key to customizing and extending the search engine. This chapter explores the core components that make intelligent search possible.

## Core Architecture Components

### Query Processing Engine

The brain that understands user queries:

- Natural language processing
- Intent recognition
- Query expansion and refinement
- Context analysis from conversation history

### AI Integration Layer

Connects to large language models:

- Multiple AI provider support
- Model selection based on query type
- Response synthesis and formatting
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Search Aggregation System

Collects information from web sources:

- Multiple search providers integration
- Result deduplication and filtering
- Source credibility assessment
- Real-time search capabilities

### Result Synthesis Engine

Combines and analyzes search results:

- Information synthesis from multiple sources
- Answer generation with citations
- Confidence scoring
- Follow-up question generation

## Data Flow Architecture

### Request Processing

```
User Query → Query Analysis → AI Processing → Search Execution → Result Synthesis → Response Generation
```

### Component Interaction

- Frontend (React/Next.js) handles user interface
- Backend (Python/FastAPI) manages business logic
- Database (PostgreSQL) stores conversation history
- Cache (Redis) improves performance
- Search providers deliver web results

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

- Load balancing across multiple instances
- Database read replicas
- Distributed caching
- API rate limit management

### Performance Optimization

- Query result caching
- AI response caching
- Search result preprocessing
- Background processing for complex queries

## Next Steps

Architecture understood. Next, AI integration details.
