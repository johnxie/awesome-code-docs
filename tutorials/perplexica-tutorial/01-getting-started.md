# Chapter 1: Getting Started with Perplexica

Welcome to Perplexica! If you've ever wished for a search engine that truly understands your questions and provides comprehensive, AI-powered answers, you're in the right place. Perplexica represents the future of intelligent search - combining web search with AI analysis for contextual, conversational answers.

## What Makes Perplexica Special?

Perplexica revolutionizes search by:

- **AI-Powered Analysis** - Uses LLMs to understand and analyze search queries
- **Web Scraping Integration** - Gathers information from multiple sources
- **Conversational Interface** - Supports follow-up questions and clarifications
- **Source Verification** - Evaluates credibility and cross-references information
- **Open Source** - Transparent and customizable search technology
- **Research Assistant** - Perfect for in-depth research and complex queries

## Installing Perplexica

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have:
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.8+
- At least 8GB RAM
- API keys for AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

### Installation Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica.git
cd Perplexica

# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your API keys
nano .env

# Start with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

### Environment Configuration

```env
# AI Provider Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key

# Search Configuration
SEARXNG_URL=http://localhost:8080
TAVILY_API_KEY=your-tavily-key

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/perplexica
```

## Your First Search Query

Once Perplexica is running:

1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. You'll see the clean search interface
3. Try a complex query: "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?"
4. Watch as Perplexica analyzes, searches, and synthesizes the answer

## Understanding the Interface

### Main Components

- **Search Box**: Natural language query input
- **Results Panel**: AI-synthesized answers with sources
- **Source Citations**: Links to original sources with credibility scores
- **Follow-up Suggestions**: Related questions to explore
- **Conversation History**: Previous queries and answers

### Search Modes

- **Research Mode**: Deep analysis with multiple sources
- **Quick Answer**: Fast responses for simple queries
- **Conversational**: Follow-up questions in context

## Sample Queries to Try

### Research Questions
```
Explain the economic impacts of artificial intelligence on job markets
```

### Technical Queries
```
How does React's virtual DOM improve performance compared to direct DOM manipulation?
```

### Comparative Analysis
```
Compare the advantages and disadvantages of GraphQL vs REST APIs
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Container Won't Start**
- Check Docker installation
- Verify port availability (3000, 5432)
- Review logs: `docker-compose logs`

**API Errors**
- Verify API keys in .env
- Check API rate limits
- Ensure correct model names

**Search Not Working**
- Confirm SearXNG is running
- Check internet connectivity
- Review search provider configuration

## Next Steps

Congratulations on setting up your AI search engine! In the next chapter, we'll dive into the architecture that makes Perplexica tick.

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Most teams struggle here because the hard part is not writing more code, but deciding clear boundaries for `your`, `Perplexica`, `Configuration` so behavior stays predictable as complexity grows.

In practical terms, this chapter helps you avoid three common failures:

- coupling core logic too tightly to one implementation path
- missing the handoff boundaries between setup, execution, and validation
- shipping changes without clear rollback or observability strategy

After working through this chapter, you should be able to reason about `Chapter 1: Getting Started with Perplexica` as an operating subsystem inside **Perplexica Tutorial: AI-Powered Search Engine**, with explicit contracts for inputs, state transitions, and outputs.

Use the implementation notes around `localhost`, `Clone`, `repository` as your checklist when adapting these patterns to your own repository.

## How it Works Under the Hood

Under the hood, `Chapter 1: Getting Started with Perplexica` usually follows a repeatable control path:

1. **Context bootstrap**: initialize runtime config and prerequisites for `your`.
2. **Input normalization**: shape incoming data so `Perplexica` receives stable contracts.
3. **Core execution**: run the main logic branch and propagate intermediate state through `Configuration`.
4. **Policy and safety checks**: enforce limits, auth scopes, and failure boundaries.
5. **Output composition**: return canonical result payloads for downstream consumers.
6. **Operational telemetry**: emit logs/metrics needed for debugging and performance tuning.

When debugging, walk this sequence in order and confirm each stage has explicit success/failure conditions.

## Source Walkthrough

Use the following upstream sources to verify implementation details while reading this chapter:

- [View Repo](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica)
  Why it matters: authoritative reference on `View Repo` (github.com).

Suggested trace strategy:
- search upstream code for `your` and `Perplexica` to map concrete implementation paths
- compare docs claims against actual runtime/config code before reusing patterns in production
