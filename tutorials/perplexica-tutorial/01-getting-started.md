## Installing Perplexica

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have:
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.8+
- At least 8GB RAM
- API keys for AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

### Installation Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica.git
cd Perplexica

# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your API keys
nano .env

# Start with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

### Environment Configuration

```env
# AI Provider Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key

# Search Configuration
SEARXNG_URL=http://localhost:8080
TAVILY_API_KEY=your-tavily-key

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/perplexica
```

## Your First Search Query

Once Perplexica is running:

1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. You'll see the clean search interface
3. Try a complex query: "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?"
4. Watch as Perplexica analyzes, searches, and synthesizes the answer

## Understanding the Interface

### Main Components

- **Search Box**: Natural language query input
- **Results Panel**: AI-synthesized answers with sources
- **Source Citations**: Links to original sources with credibility scores
- **Follow-up Suggestions**: Related questions to explore
- **Conversation History**: Previous queries and answers

### Search Modes

- **Research Mode**: Deep analysis with multiple sources
- **Quick Answer**: Fast responses for simple queries
- **Conversational**: Follow-up questions in context

## Sample Queries to Try

### Research Questions
```
Explain the economic impacts of artificial intelligence on job markets
```

### Technical Queries
```
How does React's virtual DOM improve performance compared to direct DOM manipulation?
```

### Comparative Analysis
```
Compare the advantages and disadvantages of GraphQL vs REST APIs
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Container Won't Start**
- Check Docker installation
- Verify port availability (3000, 5432)
- Review logs: `docker-compose logs`

**API Errors**
- Verify API keys in .env
- Check API rate limits
- Ensure correct model names

**Search Not Working**
- Confirm SearXNG is running
- Check internet connectivity
- Review search provider configuration
