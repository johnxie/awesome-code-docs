# Chapter 8: Production Deployment

Deploying Perplexica for production use requires careful planning for scalability, security, and reliability.

## Infrastructure Planning

### Cloud Deployment

- AWS ECS/Fargate for container orchestration
- Google Cloud Run for serverless deployment
- Azure Container Instances
- DigitalOcean App Platform

### Scaling Strategy

- Horizontal pod autoscaling
- Database read replicas
- CDN integration for static assets
- Load balancing configuration

## Security Considerations

### API Security

- API key rotation and management
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Request encryption and authentication
- Audit logging and monitoring

### Data Protection

- Database encryption at rest
- Secure communication channels
- User data privacy compliance
- Backup and disaster recovery

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Performance Monitoring

- Application performance monitoring (APM)
- Search query latency tracking
- AI model response time monitoring
- Resource usage analytics

### Maintenance Tasks

- Regular security updates
- Database optimization and cleanup
- Log rotation and archival
- Performance tuning and optimization

## Cost Optimization

### Resource Management

- Auto-scaling based on demand
- Spot instances for cost savings
- Caching strategy optimization
- Database query optimization

### Usage Analytics

- Cost per query analysis
- Usage pattern identification
- Feature utilization tracking
- Budget monitoring and alerts

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've completed the Perplexica tutorial. You're now equipped to build and deploy your own AI-powered search engine.
