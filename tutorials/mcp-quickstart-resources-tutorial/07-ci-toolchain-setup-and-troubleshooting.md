# Chapter 7: CI, Toolchain Setup, and Troubleshooting

This chapter focuses on practical operations and maintenance concerns for multi-runtime quickstart usage.

## Learning Goals

- align Node/Python/Rust toolchain prerequisites in development and CI
- diagnose common dependency and runtime errors quickly
- maintain lightweight smoke coverage with clear failure boundaries
- improve contributor onboarding for multi-language test environments

## Source References

- [Smoke Tests Guide - Requirements/Troubleshooting](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/quickstart-resources/blob/main/tests/README.md)
- [CI Workflow](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/quickstart-resources/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml)

## Summary

You now have an operations baseline for sustaining quickstart-based development loops.
