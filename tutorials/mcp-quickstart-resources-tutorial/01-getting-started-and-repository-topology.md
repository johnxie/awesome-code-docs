# Chapter 1: Getting Started and Repository Topology

This chapter introduces the purpose and structure of the quickstart resource corpus.

## Learning Goals

- understand how server/client examples map to official tutorials
- identify language directories and their intended use
- choose a first example path for your runtime preference
- avoid confusing quickstart references with production templates

## Repository Anatomy

| Area | Purpose |
|:-----|:--------|
| `weather-server-*` | basic MCP server examples by language |
| `mcp-client-*` | basic MCP client examples by language |
| `tests/` | cross-runtime smoke tests and helper tooling |

## Source References

- [Quickstart Resources README](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/quickstart-resources/blob/main/README.md)

## Summary

You now have a clear map of quickstart assets and intended usage.
