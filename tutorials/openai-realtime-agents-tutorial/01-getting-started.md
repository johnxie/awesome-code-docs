# Chapter 1: Getting Started

Welcome to **Chapter 1: Getting Started**. In this part of **OpenAI Realtime Agents Tutorial: Voice-First AI Systems**, you will build an intuitive mental model first, then move into concrete implementation details and practical production tradeoffs.


This chapter gets the official realtime demo running locally and establishes a baseline you can measure future changes against.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- run the official demo end to end
- explain the local components that participate in a realtime voice session
- validate microphone, session, and tool-call flow quickly
- identify the most common local setup failures

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm or pnpm
- OpenAI API access with Realtime capability
- modern browser with microphone permissions

## Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-agents.git
cd openai-realtime-agents
npm install
cp .env.sample .env
# add OPENAI_API_KEY
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` and run both built-in scenarios to compare orchestration behavior.

    A --> C[Realtime Connection]
    C --> D[Realtime Agent Runtime]
    D --> E[Tools and Handoffs]
    E --> A
```

## First-Run Validation Checklist

1. session creation succeeds and short-lived credentials are returned
2. microphone capture starts and input meters move
3. model responses stream in text/audio without long stalls
4. tool calls appear in logs for scenarios that need external actions
5. agent handoffs are visible in timeline/transcript when using multi-agent scenarios

## Quick Health Commands

Use these while debugging startup problems:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
cat .env | rg OPENAI_API_KEY
npm run dev
```

## Common Setup Failures

| Failure | Most Likely Cause | First Fix |
|:--------|:------------------|:----------|
| 401/403 on session endpoint | missing or invalid API key | regenerate key, reload dev server |
| microphone appears silent | browser permission denied | re-enable mic permission and refresh |
| no realtime events | transport connection failed | inspect browser network and server logs |
| no tool/handoff activity | wrong scenario or config mismatch | rerun stock scenario before custom edits |

## Baseline Test Script

Before any customization, run this short baseline test:

- ask for a simple greeting and confirm low-latency response
- interrupt output mid-sentence and verify barge-in behavior
- trigger a scenario that requires tool invocation
- verify transcript coherence after handoff

If these four checks pass, your local environment is stable enough for deeper protocol work.

## Depth Expansion Playbook

<!-- depth-expansion-v2 -->

This chapter is expanded to v1-style depth for production-grade learning and implementation quality.

### Strategic Context

- tutorial: **OpenAI Realtime Agents Tutorial: Voice-First AI Systems**
- tutorial slug: **openai-realtime-agents-tutorial**
- chapter focus: **Chapter 1: Getting Started**
- system context: **Openai Realtime Agents Tutorial**
- objective: move from surface-level usage to repeatable engineering operation

### Architecture Decomposition

1. Define the runtime boundary for `Chapter 1: Getting Started`.
2. Separate control-plane decisions from data-plane execution.
3. Capture input contracts, transformation points, and output contracts.
4. Trace state transitions across request lifecycle stages.
5. Identify extension hooks and policy interception points.
6. Map ownership boundaries for team and automation workflows.
7. Specify rollback and recovery paths for unsafe changes.
8. Track observability signals for correctness, latency, and cost.

### Operator Decision Matrix

| Decision Area | Low-Risk Path | High-Control Path | Tradeoff |
|:--------------|:--------------|:------------------|:---------|
| Runtime mode | managed defaults | explicit policy config | speed vs control |
| State handling | local ephemeral | durable persisted state | simplicity vs auditability |
| Tool integration | direct API use | mediated adapter layer | velocity vs governance |
| Rollout method | manual change | staged + canary rollout | effort vs safety |
| Incident response | best effort logs | runbooks + SLO alerts | cost vs reliability |

### Failure Modes and Countermeasures

| Failure Mode | Early Signal | Root Cause Pattern | Countermeasure |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------------|:---------------|
| stale context | inconsistent outputs | missing refresh window | enforce context TTL and refresh hooks |
| policy drift | unexpected execution | ad hoc overrides | centralize policy profiles |
| auth mismatch | 401/403 bursts | credential sprawl | rotation schedule + scope minimization |
| schema breakage | parser/validation errors | unmanaged upstream changes | contract tests per release |
| retry storms | queue congestion | no backoff controls | jittered backoff + circuit breakers |
| silent regressions | quality drop without alerts | weak baseline metrics | eval harness with thresholds |

### Implementation Runbook

1. Establish a reproducible baseline environment.
2. Capture chapter-specific success criteria before changes.
3. Implement minimal viable path with explicit interfaces.
4. Add observability before expanding feature scope.
5. Run deterministic tests for happy-path behavior.
6. Inject failure scenarios for negative-path validation.
7. Compare output quality against baseline snapshots.
8. Promote through staged environments with rollback gates.
9. Record operational lessons in release notes.

5. Run a staged rollout and document rollback decision criteria.

### Review Questions

1. Which execution boundary matters most for this chapter and why?
2. What signal detects regressions earliest in your environment?
3. What tradeoff did you make between delivery speed and governance?
4. How would you recover from the highest-impact failure mode?
5. What must be automated before scaling to team-wide adoption?

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Most teams struggle here because the hard part is not writing more code, but deciding clear boundaries for `openai`, `realtime`, `agents` so behavior stays predictable as complexity grows.

In practical terms, this chapter helps you avoid three common failures:

- coupling core logic too tightly to one implementation path
- missing the handoff boundaries between setup, execution, and validation
- shipping changes without clear rollback or observability strategy

After working through this chapter, you should be able to reason about `Chapter 1: Getting Started` as an operating subsystem inside **OpenAI Realtime Agents Tutorial: Voice-First AI Systems**, with explicit contracts for inputs, state transitions, and outputs.

Use the implementation notes around `Realtime`, `clone`, `https` as your checklist when adapting these patterns to your own repository.

## How it Works Under the Hood

Under the hood, `Chapter 1: Getting Started` usually follows a repeatable control path:

1. **Context bootstrap**: initialize runtime config and prerequisites for `openai`.
2. **Input normalization**: shape incoming data so `realtime` receives stable contracts.
3. **Core execution**: run the main logic branch and propagate intermediate state through `agents`.
4. **Policy and safety checks**: enforce limits, auth scopes, and failure boundaries.
5. **Output composition**: return canonical result payloads for downstream consumers.
6. **Operational telemetry**: emit logs/metrics needed for debugging and performance tuning.

When debugging, walk this sequence in order and confirm each stage has explicit success/failure conditions.

## Source Walkthrough

Use the following upstream sources to verify implementation details while reading this chapter:

- [openai/openai-realtime-agents Repository](https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-agents)
  Why it matters: authoritative reference on `openai/openai-realtime-agents Repository` (github.com).
- [OpenAI Realtime API Guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime)

- [OpenAI API Deprecations](https://platform.openai.com/docs/deprecations)
  Why it matters: authoritative reference on `OpenAI API Deprecations` (platform.openai.com).
- [OpenAI Agents JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-js)
  Why it matters: authoritative reference on `OpenAI Agents JavaScript SDK` (github.com).

Suggested trace strategy:
- search upstream code for `openai` and `realtime` to map concrete implementation paths
- compare docs claims against actual runtime/config code before reusing patterns in production
