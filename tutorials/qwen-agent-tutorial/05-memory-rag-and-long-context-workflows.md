# Chapter 5: Memory, RAG, and Long-Context Workflows

This chapter covers knowledge-heavy workflows requiring retrieval and long-context handling.

## Learning Goals

- apply RAG patterns for large document tasks
- choose between fast and higher-cost long-context approaches
- combine retrieval with tool reasoning effectively
- validate output quality on document-intensive tasks

## Workflow Guidance

- start with efficient RAG pipelines for scale
- escalate to more expensive agentic flows when needed
- track recall and citation quality in evaluation loops

## Source References

- [Core Modules: RAG](https://qwenlm.github.io/Qwen-Agent/en/guide/core_moduls/rag/)
- [RAG Example](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent/blob/main/examples/assistant_rag.py)
- [Parallel Doc QA Example](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent/blob/main/examples/parallel_doc_qa.py)

## Summary

You now can design Qwen-Agent workflows for high-context and document-heavy workloads.
