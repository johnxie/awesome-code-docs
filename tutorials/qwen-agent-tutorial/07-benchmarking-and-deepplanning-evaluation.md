# Chapter 7: Benchmarking and DeepPlanning Evaluation

This chapter focuses on long-horizon planning benchmarks and evaluation quality.

## Learning Goals

- understand DeepPlanning benchmark design goals
- evaluate long-horizon planning behavior and constraints
- track local vs global planning failures
- use benchmark insights to guide model/tool improvements

## Evaluation Priorities

- assess proactive information acquisition
- verify local constraint satisfaction
- verify global optimization under budget/time constraints

## Source References

## Summary

You now have a benchmark-driven evaluation model for long-horizon Qwen-Agent tasks.
