# Chapter 2: Framework Architecture and Core Modules

This chapter explains the internal framework layers and extension surfaces.

## Learning Goals

- understand agent, llm, tool, and context module boundaries
- identify extension points for custom agents/tools
- map high-level assistants to low-level primitives
- reason about framework composition for real applications

## Core Module Areas

- agent orchestration
- llm wrappers and generation config
- tools/function calling interfaces
- context/memory and retrieval layers

## Source References

- [Core Modules: Agent](https://qwenlm.github.io/Qwen-Agent/en/guide/core_moduls/agent/)
- [Core Modules: LLM](https://qwenlm.github.io/Qwen-Agent/en/guide/core_moduls/llm/)
- [Core Modules: Tool](https://qwenlm.github.io/Qwen-Agent/en/guide/core_moduls/tool/)

## Summary

You now have a reliable mental model for Qwen-Agent framework internals.
