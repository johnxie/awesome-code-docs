# Chapter 7: Performance Tuning

Performance tuning is critical for maximizing ClickHouse's analytical capabilities. This chapter covers advanced optimization techniques, memory management, and system-level tuning for production workloads.

## System-Level Optimization

### Server Configuration Tuning

```xml
<!-- Optimized ClickHouse server configuration -->
<clickhouse>
    <!-- Memory Settings -->
    <max_memory_usage>107374182400</max_memory_usage>  <!-- 100GB -->
    <max_memory_usage_for_user>85899345920</max_memory_usage_for_user>  <!-- 80GB -->
    <max_memory_usage_for_all_queries>64424509440</max_memory_usage_for_all_queries>  <!-- 60GB -->

    <!-- Thread Settings -->
    <max_threads>32</max_threads>
    <max_insert_threads>8</max_insert_threads>
    <background_pool_size>16</background_pool_size>

    <!-- Cache Settings -->
    <uncompressed_cache_size>2147483648</uncompressed_cache_size>  <!-- 2GB -->
    <mark_cache_size>2147483648</mark_cache_size>  <!-- 2GB -->
    <mmap_cache_size>1073741824</mmap_cache_size>  <!-- 1GB -->

    <!-- Merge Settings -->
    <merge_max_block_size>8192</merge_max_block_size>
    <merge_threads>8</merge_threads>
    <merge_tree>
        <max_parts_in_total>10000</max_parts_in_total>
        <max_parts_to_merge_at_once>100</max_parts_to_merge_at_once>
    </merge_tree>
</clickhouse>
```

### Hardware Optimization

```bash
# CPU optimization
echo "performance" | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

# Memory optimization
echo "always" > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
echo "madvise" > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag

# Disk optimization
echo "deadline" > /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
echo "1024" > /sys/block/sda/queue/nr_requests
echo "1024" > /sys/block/sda/queue/read_ahead_kb

# Network optimization
echo "4096 87380 6291456" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem
echo "4096 87380 6291456" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_wmem
```

## Query-Level Optimizations

### Advanced Query Settings

```sql
-- Global query optimization settings
SET max_threads = 16;
SET max_memory_usage = 10000000000;  -- 10GB
SET max_bytes_before_external_group_by = 5000000000;  -- 5GB
SET max_bytes_before_external_sort = 5000000000;  -- 5GB
SET max_result_rows = 1000000;
SET max_result_bytes = 100000000;  -- 100MB

-- Execute optimized query
SELECT
    toDate(timestamp) as date,
    count() as events,
    uniq(user_id) as unique_users,
    sum(value) as total_value
FROM events
WHERE timestamp >= '2024-01-01'
    AND event_type IN ('login', 'purchase')
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY date DESC
SETTINGS
    optimize_read_in_order = 1,
    optimize_aggregation_in_order = 1,
    optimize_move_to_prewhere = 1,
    read_overflow_mode = 'break';
```

### Prewhere Optimization

```sql
-- Prewhere for selective filtering
SELECT
    user_id,
    count() as actions,
    sum(value) as total_value
FROM user_events
PREWHERE timestamp >= '2024-01-01'  -- Filters applied before reading columns
    AND event_type = 'purchase'
WHERE user_id IN (SELECT user_id FROM active_users)  -- Additional filtering
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY total_value DESC;

-- Prewhere with multiple conditions
SELECT
    user_id,
    event_type,
    count() as count,
    avg(value) as avg_value
FROM events
PREWHERE timestamp >= '2024-01-01'
    AND user_id % 100 = 0  -- Selective user sampling
WHERE event_type IN ('view', 'click', 'purchase')
GROUP BY user_id, event_type;
```

## Memory Management

### Memory-Efficient Aggregations

```sql
-- Memory-efficient group by
SELECT
    category,
    count() as total,
    sum(amount) as total_amount,
    avg(amount) as avg_amount
FROM transactions
GROUP BY category
SETTINGS
    max_bytes_before_external_group_by = 1000000000,  -- 1GB
    group_by_two_level_threshold = 100000,
    group_by_two_level_threshold_bytes = 100000000;   -- 100MB

-- External aggregation for large datasets
SELECT
    user_id,
    count() as events,
    sum(value) as total_value
FROM large_events_table
GROUP BY user_id
SETTINGS
    max_memory_usage = 2000000000,  -- 2GB limit
    max_bytes_before_external_group_by = 500000000;  -- 500MB
```

### Memory Monitoring

```sql
-- Monitor memory usage
SELECT
    query_id,
    query,
    memory_usage,
    peak_memory_usage,
    ProfileEvents['MemoryTrackerAlloc'] as memory_allocated,
    ProfileEvents['MemoryTrackerFree'] as memory_freed
FROM system.query_log
WHERE type = 'QueryFinish'
    AND peak_memory_usage > 1000000000  -- > 1GB
ORDER BY peak_memory_usage DESC;

-- Real-time memory statistics
SELECT
    metric,
    value,
    description
FROM system.metrics
WHERE metric LIKE '%memory%'
    OR metric LIKE '%alloc%';
```

## Storage Optimization

### Compression Tuning

```sql
-- Optimize compression for different data types
CREATE TABLE optimized_events (
    timestamp DateTime CODEC(Delta, ZSTD(6)),
    user_id UInt32 CODEC(LZ4),
    event_type LowCardinality(String) CODEC(ZSTD(3)),
    message String CODEC(ZSTD(9)),  -- Higher compression for text
    value Nullable(Float64) CODEC(Gorilla)
) ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY (timestamp, user_id)
SETTINGS
    min_rows_for_wide_part = 0,      -- Force wide parts
    min_bytes_for_wide_part = 0,
    index_granularity = 8192;

-- Compression ratio analysis
SELECT
    database,
    table,
    sum(bytes) as uncompressed_bytes,
    sum(compressed_bytes) as compressed_bytes,
    sum(compressed_bytes) / sum(bytes) as compression_ratio
FROM system.columns
WHERE database = 'your_db'
GROUP BY database, table
ORDER BY compression_ratio;
```

### Index Optimization

```sql
-- Granular indexing strategy
CREATE TABLE indexed_events (
    timestamp DateTime,
    user_id UInt32,
    event_type String,
    category LowCardinality(String),
    value Float64,
    metadata String
) ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY (timestamp, user_id, category)
SETTINGS
    index_granularity = 8192,        -- Smaller granules = faster queries
    merge_max_block_size = 8192,
    min_rows_for_wide_part = 0;

-- Skip indexes for selective queries
CREATE TABLE skip_index_events (
    timestamp DateTime,
    user_id UInt32,
    event_type LowCardinality(String),
    status LowCardinality(String),
    value Float64
) ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY timestamp
SETTINGS
    index_granularity = 8192;

-- Analyze index effectiveness
SELECT
    database,
    table,
    name,
    type,
    granularity,
    num_parts,
    marks_count
FROM system.columns
WHERE database = 'your_db'
    AND type LIKE '%Index%';
```

## Query Result Caching

### Query Cache Configuration

```xml
<!-- Enable query result cache -->
<clickhouse>
    <query_cache>
        <max_size_in_bytes>1073741824</max_size_in_bytes>  <!-- 1GB -->
        <max_entries>10000</max_entries>
        <max_entry_size_in_bytes>104857600</max_entry_size_in_bytes>  <!-- 100MB -->
        <ttl>3600000</ttl>  <!-- 1 hour -->
    </query_cache>
</clickhouse>
```

### Cache Usage

```sql
-- Enable query caching
SET query_cache_store_results = 1;
SET query_cache_ttl = 3600;  -- 1 hour TTL

-- Cache expensive aggregations
SELECT
    toDate(timestamp) as date,
    count() as daily_events,
    uniq(user_id) as daily_users,
    sum(value) as daily_value
FROM events
WHERE timestamp >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY date
SETTINGS
    use_query_cache = 1,
    query_cache_min_query_duration = 5000;  -- Cache queries > 5s

-- Monitor cache performance
SELECT
    ProfileEvents['QueryCacheHits'] as cache_hits,
    ProfileEvents['QueryCacheMisses'] as cache_misses,
    ProfileEvents['QueryCacheHits'] / (ProfileEvents['QueryCacheHits'] + ProfileEvents['QueryCacheMisses']) as hit_rate
FROM system.query_log
WHERE query_id = 'your_query_id';
```

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

SETTINGS
    max_threads = 32,
    max_distributed_connections = 8,
    distributed_group_by_no_merge = 0,
    optimize_distributed_group_by_sharding_key = 1;

-- Parallel aggregation
SELECT
    toStartOfHour(timestamp) as hour,
    count() as events_per_hour,
    uniq(user_id) as unique_users_per_hour
FROM distributed_events
GROUP BY hour
SETTINGS
    max_parallel_replicas = 3,
    cluster = 'analytics_cluster';
```

### Pre-computed Views

-- Materialized view for real-time analytics
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW realtime_user_stats
ENGINE = AggregatingMergeTree()
ORDER BY (user_id, minute)
AS SELECT
    user_id,
    toStartOfMinute(timestamp) as minute,
    countState() as events_count,
    sumState(value) as total_value,
    avgState(value) as avg_value
FROM user_events
GROUP BY user_id, minute;

SELECT
    user_id,
    countMerge(events_count) as total_events,
    sumMerge(total_value) as total_value,
    avgMerge(avg_value) as avg_value
FROM realtime_user_stats
WHERE minute >= now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY total_events DESC;
```

### Approximate Query Processing

    quantileTDigest(0.95)(response_time) as p95_response,
    quantileTDigest(0.99)(response_time) as p99_response
FROM api_logs
WHERE timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR;

-- Approximate top-k
SELECT
    topK(10)(product_name) as top_products,
    topKWeighted(10)(product_name, sales) as top_by_sales
FROM product_sales;
```
