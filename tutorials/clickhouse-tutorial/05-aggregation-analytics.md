# Chapter 5: Aggregation & Analytics

ClickHouse excels at analytical workloads with its powerful aggregation functions and real-time analytics capabilities. This chapter covers advanced aggregation techniques and analytical patterns for building high-performance analytical applications.

## Advanced Aggregation Functions

### Statistical Aggregations

```sql
-- Statistical analysis functions
SELECT
    category,
    count() as total_count,
    avg(price) as avg_price,
    median(price) as median_price,
    quantile(0.25)(price) as q25_price,
    quantile(0.75)(price) as q75_price,
    stddevPop(price) as std_dev,
    skewnessPop(price) as skewness,
    kurtosisPop(price) as kurtosis
FROM products
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_count DESC;

-- Time-series statistical analysis
SELECT
    toStartOfHour(timestamp) as hour,
    count() as events_count,
    avg(response_time) as avg_response,
    quantileExact(0.95)(response_time) as p95_response,
    quantileExact(0.99)(response_time) as p99_response,
    min(response_time) as min_response,
    max(response_time) as max_response
FROM api_logs
WHERE timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 24 HOUR
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY hour;
```

### Array and String Aggregations

```sql
-- Array aggregation functions
SELECT
    user_id,
    groupArray(event_type) as event_sequence,
    arrayDistinct(groupArray(event_type)) as unique_events,
    arrayCount(x -> x = 'purchase', groupArray(event_type)) as purchase_count,
    arraySum(groupArray(value)) as total_value
FROM user_events
GROUP BY user_id;

-- String aggregation functions
SELECT
    category,
    groupArrayConcat(',', product_name) as product_list,
    groupArrayConcat('|', tag) as tag_string,
    countDistinct(product_name) as unique_products
FROM products
GROUP BY category;
```

### Custom Aggregation States

```sql
-- Using aggregate state functions
CREATE TABLE user_metrics (
    user_id UInt32,
    date Date,
    page_views UInt32,
    session_duration UInt32
) ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY (user_id, date);

-- Aggregate states for efficient merging
SELECT
    user_id,
    sumState(page_views) as total_views_state,
    avgState(session_duration) as avg_duration_state,
    countState() as session_count_state
FROM user_metrics
GROUP BY user_id;

-- Merge states across different time periods
SELECT
    user_id,
    sumMerge(total_views_state) as total_views,
    avgMerge(avg_duration_state) as avg_duration,
    countMerge(session_count_state) as total_sessions
FROM (
    SELECT user_id, sumState(page_views) as total_views_state,
           avgState(session_duration) as avg_duration_state,
           countState() as session_count_state
    FROM user_metrics
    WHERE date >= '2024-01-01'
    GROUP BY user_id
) t
GROUP BY user_id;
```

## Real-Time Analytics

### Sliding Window Analytics

```sql
-- Sliding window aggregations
SELECT
    user_id,
    timestamp,
    event_type,
    count() OVER (
        PARTITION BY user_id
        ORDER BY timestamp
        RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL 1 HOUR PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as events_last_hour,
    sum(value) OVER (
        PARTITION BY user_id
        ORDER BY timestamp
        RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL 24 HOUR PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as value_last_24h
FROM user_events
ORDER BY user_id, timestamp;

-- Tumbling window analytics
SELECT
    toStartOfHour(timestamp) as hour,
    count() as events_per_hour,
    uniq(user_id) as unique_users,
    sum(value) as total_value,
    avg(value) as avg_value
FROM events
WHERE timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY hour DESC;
```

### Continuous Aggregation

```sql
-- Continuous aggregation with materialized views
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW hourly_user_stats
ENGINE = AggregatingMergeTree()
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(hour)
ORDER BY (hour, user_id)
AS SELECT
    toStartOfHour(timestamp) as hour,
    user_id,
    countState() as events_count,
    sumState(value) as total_value,
    avgState(value) as avg_value,
    minState(timestamp) as first_event,
    maxState(timestamp) as last_event
FROM user_events
GROUP BY hour, user_id;

-- Query real-time stats
SELECT
    user_id,
    countMerge(events_count) as total_events,
    sumMerge(total_value) as total_value,
    avgMerge(avg_value) as avg_value,
    minMerge(first_event) as first_event_time,
    maxMerge(last_event) as last_event_time

    SELECT
        user_id,
        groupArray(event_type) as event_sequence,
        arrayCount(x -> x = 'page_view', event_sequence) > 0 as step1_page_view,
        arrayCount(x -> x = 'add_to_cart', event_sequence) > 0 as step2_add_to_cart,
        arrayCount(x -> x = 'checkout', event_sequence) > 0 as step3_checkout,
        arrayCount(x -> x = 'purchase', event_sequence) > 0 as step4_purchase
    FROM (
        SELECT user_id, event_type
        FROM user_events
        WHERE timestamp >= '2024-01-01'

    round(step3_count / step2_count * 100, 2) as step3_conversion,
    round(step4_count / step3_count * 100, 2) as step4_conversion
FROM user_steps;
```

### Time-Series Forecasting

```sql
-- Simple trend analysis
SELECT
    date,
    sales,
    avg(sales) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as moving_avg_7d,
    sales - lag(sales) OVER (ORDER BY date) as daily_change,
    (sales - lag(sales, 7) OVER (ORDER BY date)) / lag(sales, 7) OVER (ORDER BY date) * 100 as weekly_change_pct
FROM daily_sales
WHERE date >= '2024-01-01'
ORDER BY date;

-- Seasonal decomposition
SELECT
    toYear(date) as year,
    toMonth(date) as month,
    avg(sales) as monthly_avg,
    avg(sales) OVER (PARTITION BY toMonth(date)) as seasonal_avg,
    avg(sales) - avg(sales) OVER (PARTITION BY toMonth(date)) as seasonal_adjusted
FROM daily_sales
GROUP BY year, month, date
ORDER BY year, month;
```

## Performance Optimization for Analytics

### Pre-computed Aggregations

```sql

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW product_analytics
ENGINE = SummingMergeTree()
ORDER BY (product_id, date)
AS SELECT
    product_id,
    toDate(timestamp) as date,
    count() as views,
    countIf(event_type = 'purchase') as purchases,
    sumIf(value, event_type = 'purchase') as revenue,
    uniq(user_id) as unique_viewers
FROM product_events
GROUP BY product_id, date;

-- Query optimized analytics
SELECT
    product_id,
    sum(views) as total_views,
    sum(purchases) as total_purchases,
    sum(revenue) as total_revenue,
    sum(unique_viewers) as total_unique_viewers,
    sum(purchases) / sum(views) as conversion_rate
FROM product_analytics
WHERE date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

### Approximate Aggregations

    GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT
    c.cohort_date,
    count() as cohort_size,
    avg(r.total_revenue) as avg_clv,
    quantile(0.5)(r.total_revenue) as median_clv,
    sum(r.total_revenue) as total_cohort_revenue,
    avg(c.lifetime_months) as avg_lifetime_months
FROM user_cohorts c
LEFT JOIN user_revenue r ON c.user_id = r.user_id
GROUP BY c.cohort_date
ORDER BY c.cohort_date DESC;
```

### Product Affinity Analysis

```sql

    SELECT
        user_id,
        groupArray(product_id) as purchased_products,
        arrayDistinct(groupArray(product_id)) as unique_products
    FROM purchase_events
    WHERE timestamp >= '2024-01-01'
    GROUP BY user_id
),
product_pairs AS (
    SELECT
        arrayJoin(arrayDistinct(
            arrayMap(x -> (x, y), purchased_products, purchased_products)
        )) as product_pair,
        count() as frequency
    FROM user_purchases
    WHERE length(purchased_products) > 1
    GROUP BY product_pair
)
SELECT
    product_pair.1 as product_a,
    product_pair.2 as product_b,
    frequency,
    frequency / (SELECT count() FROM user_purchases) as support
FROM product_pairs
WHERE product_pair.1 < product_pair.2  -- Avoid duplicates
ORDER BY frequency DESC
LIMIT 20;
```
