# LLaMA-Factory Tutorial: Unified Framework for LLM Training and Fine-tuning

> This tutorial is AI-generated! To learn more, check out [Awesome Code Docs](https://github.com/johnxie/awesome-code-docs)

LLaMA-Factory<sup>[View Repo](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory)</sup> is a unified framework designed to streamline the entire lifecycle of large language model (LLM) development. It provides an easy-to-use interface for training, fine-tuning, evaluation, and deployment of LLMs, supporting multiple model architectures and training methodologies.

LLaMA-Factory democratizes access to advanced LLM capabilities by providing a unified, user-friendly interface that works across different model architectures and training scenarios.
