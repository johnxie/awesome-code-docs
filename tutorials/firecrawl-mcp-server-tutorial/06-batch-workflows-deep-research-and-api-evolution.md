# Chapter 6: Batch Workflows, Deep Research, and API Evolution

Firecrawl MCP has evolved from legacy V1 tooling to modern V2 behavior; teams need to plan around those differences.

## Learning Goals

- understand batch processing behavior and limits
- map V1-only capabilities versus V2 defaults
- plan endpoint migration without breaking clients

## Evolution Highlights

| Version | Notable Focus |
|:--------|:--------------|
| V1 | legacy endpoints plus deep-research/llmstxt oriented tools |
| V2 | modern API methods, improved extraction/search behavior |

## Summary

You now have a migration-aware perspective on batch and advanced Firecrawl MCP usage.
