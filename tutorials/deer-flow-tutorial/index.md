## 🎯 What is Deer Flow?

**Deer Flow** is a distributed workflow orchestration platform designed for coordinating complex tasks across multiple systems and services. It provides a robust framework for building, executing, and monitoring distributed workflows with support for parallelism, fault tolerance, and dynamic scaling.

### Key Features
- 🔀 **Workflow Orchestration** - Complex task coordination and execution
- 📊 **Distributed Processing** - Scale across multiple nodes and clusters
- 🛡️ **Fault Tolerance** - Automatic retry and recovery mechanisms
- 📈 **Dynamic Scaling** - Auto-scale based on workload demands
- 🎯 **Task Dependencies** - Define complex dependency relationships
- 📊 **Monitoring & Observability** - Comprehensive workflow monitoring
- 🔌 **Extensible Architecture** - Custom task types and integrations
- ⏱️ **Scheduling** - Time-based and event-driven execution
