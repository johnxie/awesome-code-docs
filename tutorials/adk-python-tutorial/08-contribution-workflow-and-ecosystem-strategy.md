# Chapter 8: Contribution Workflow and Ecosystem Strategy

This chapter maps how to contribute effectively to ADK and leverage its broader ecosystem.

## Learning Goals

- follow ADK contribution and test requirements
- align docs and code updates across repos
- use community resources for faster delivery
- plan ecosystem integration without lock-in

## Contribution Priorities

- keep PRs focused and test-backed
- include issue context for non-trivial changes
- update docs when behavior changes
- validate with unit and end-to-end test evidence

## Ecosystem Surfaces

- `google/adk-samples` for implementation patterns
- `google/adk-python-community` for community integrations
- A2A integrations for remote agent-to-agent workflows

## Source References

- [ADK Contributing Guide](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Summary

You now have a full ADK production learning path from first run to ecosystem-level contribution.
