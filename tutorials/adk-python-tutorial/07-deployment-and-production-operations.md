# Chapter 7: Deployment and Production Operations

This chapter covers production packaging and run operations for ADK projects.

## Learning Goals

- choose deployment targets by workload profile
- package and version agent services cleanly
- add observability and rollback practices
- operate with security and governance controls

## Deployment Paths

- local or containerized services for team workflows
- Cloud Run style deployments for managed scaling
- Vertex AI Agent Engine paths for enterprise integration

## Operational Checklist

- pin dependency and model configuration
- capture invocation and tool telemetry
- define rollback and incident response runbooks
- enforce change approval for risky tool actions

## Source References

- [ADK README: Deploy Anywhere](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/README.md#-key-features)
- [ADK Deploy Docs](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/deploy/)
- [ADK Web Repository](https://github.com/google/adk-web)

## Summary

You can now move ADK agents from prototype into production operations with clearer controls.
