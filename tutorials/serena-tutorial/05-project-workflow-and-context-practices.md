# Chapter 5: Project Workflow and Context Practices

This chapter focuses on day-to-day operating habits that maximize Serena's value.

## Learning Goals

- apply Serena's project-based workflow model
- structure tasks to exploit semantic retrieval efficiently
- reduce unnecessary context churn in long sessions
- improve quality on large and strongly structured repos

## Workflow Practices

1. start each task with explicit objective + target module scope
2. retrieve symbols before editing full files
3. follow references before bulk refactors
4. validate changed symbols with focused tests

## Where Serena Helps Most

Serena is especially effective when:

- repositories are large and modular
- relationship tracking between symbols matters
- token budgets are constrained in long sessions

## Source References

- [Project Workflow](https://oraios.github.io/serena/02-usage/040_workflow.html)
- [Serena README: Community Feedback](https://github.com/oraios/serena/blob/main/README.md#community-feedback)

## Summary

You now have practical workflow patterns for getting consistent value from Serena.
