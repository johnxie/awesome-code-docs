## What Is Athens Research?

Athens is an open-source knowledge management system inspired by Roam Research. It uses Datascript (an in-memory graph database) with ClojureScript to provide block-based editing, bi-directional linking, and knowledge graph visualization — all running locally for full data ownership.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Block-Based Editor** | Flexible, composable content editing with outliner UX |
| **Bi-Directional Links** | Automatic backlinks between pages and blocks |
| **Graph Database** | Datascript in-memory graph for knowledge relationships |
| **Knowledge Graph** | Interactive visualization of connections between notes |
| **Local-First** | All data stored locally, no cloud dependency |
| **Real-Time Collab** | Multi-user editing with conflict resolution |

## Architecture Overview

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Frontend["ClojureScript Frontend"]
        EDITOR[Block Editor]
        GRAPH[Graph Visualization]
        SEARCH[Search Interface]
    end

    subgraph State["State Management"]
        REFRAME[Re-frame Events]
        SUBS[Subscriptions]
    end

    subgraph Data["Data Layer"]
        DS[(Datascript DB)]
        FS[File System]
        SYNC[Sync Engine]
    end

    Frontend --> State
    State --> Data
```
