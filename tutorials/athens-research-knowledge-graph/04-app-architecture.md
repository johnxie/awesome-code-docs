# Chapter 4: Application Architecture

Welcome to **Chapter 4: Application Architecture**. In this part of **Athens Research: Deep Dive Tutorial**, you will build an intuitive mental model first, then move into concrete implementation details and practical production tradeoffs.


This chapter explains Athens' app architecture around Re-frame event flow and UI composition.

## Core Architecture Pattern

Athens uses a classic Re-frame loop:

1. UI dispatches an event.
2. Event handler produces effects.
3. Effects update Datascript-backed app state.
4. Subscriptions recompute derived views.
5. Reagent components re-render.

## Important Design Boundaries

- Keep data normalization in event handlers and effects.
- Keep view components declarative and subscription-driven.
- Keep business workflows explicit in event namespaces.

## Event and Subscription Layout

```clojure
(ns athens.events)
(reg-event-fx
  :page/open
  (fn [{:keys [db]} [_ page-id]]
    {:db (assoc db :ui/current-page page-id)
     :dispatch [:graph/load-page page-id]}))

(reg-sub
  :ui/current-page
  (fn [db _] (:ui/current-page db)))
```

## Reliability Practices

- Prefer idempotent handlers for repeated UI actions.
- Separate optimistic UI updates from persistence effects.
- Log event IDs for debugging long state transitions.

## Summary

You can now reason about Athens' event-driven architecture and where to place logic.

Next: [Chapter 5: Component System](05-component-system.md)

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Most teams struggle here because the hard part is not writing more code, but deciding clear boundaries for `page`, `current`, `athens` so behavior stays predictable as complexity grows.

In practical terms, this chapter helps you avoid three common failures:

- coupling core logic too tightly to one implementation path
- missing the handoff boundaries between setup, execution, and validation
- shipping changes without clear rollback or observability strategy

After working through this chapter, you should be able to reason about `Chapter 4: Application Architecture` as an operating subsystem inside **Athens Research: Deep Dive Tutorial**, with explicit contracts for inputs, state transitions, and outputs.

Use the implementation notes around `events`, `event`, `open` as your checklist when adapting these patterns to your own repository.

## How it Works Under the Hood

Under the hood, `Chapter 4: Application Architecture` usually follows a repeatable control path:

1. **Context bootstrap**: initialize runtime config and prerequisites for `page`.
2. **Input normalization**: shape incoming data so `current` receives stable contracts.
3. **Core execution**: run the main logic branch and propagate intermediate state through `athens`.
4. **Policy and safety checks**: enforce limits, auth scopes, and failure boundaries.
5. **Output composition**: return canonical result payloads for downstream consumers.
6. **Operational telemetry**: emit logs/metrics needed for debugging and performance tuning.

When debugging, walk this sequence in order and confirm each stage has explicit success/failure conditions.

## Source Walkthrough

Use the following upstream sources to verify implementation details while reading this chapter:

- [Athens Research](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens)
  Why it matters: authoritative reference on `Athens Research` (github.com).

Suggested trace strategy:
- search upstream code for `page` and `current` to map concrete implementation paths
- compare docs claims against actual runtime/config code before reusing patterns in production

### Strategic Context

- tutorial: **Athens Research: Deep Dive Tutorial**
- tutorial slug: **athens-research-knowledge-graph**
- chapter focus: **Chapter 4: Application Architecture**
- system context: **Athens Research Knowledge Graph**
- objective: move from surface-level usage to repeatable engineering operation

### Architecture Decomposition

1. Define the runtime boundary for `Chapter 4: Application Architecture`.
2. Separate control-plane decisions from data-plane execution.
3. Capture input contracts, transformation points, and output contracts.
4. Trace state transitions across request lifecycle stages.
5. Identify extension hooks and policy interception points.
6. Map ownership boundaries for team and automation workflows.
7. Specify rollback and recovery paths for unsafe changes.
8. Track observability signals for correctness, latency, and cost.

### Operator Decision Matrix

| Decision Area | Low-Risk Path | High-Control Path | Tradeoff |
|:--------------|:--------------|:------------------|:---------|
| Runtime mode | managed defaults | explicit policy config | speed vs control |
| State handling | local ephemeral | durable persisted state | simplicity vs auditability |
| Tool integration | direct API use | mediated adapter layer | velocity vs governance |
| Rollout method | manual change | staged + canary rollout | effort vs safety |
| Incident response | best effort logs | runbooks + SLO alerts | cost vs reliability |

### Failure Modes and Countermeasures

| Failure Mode | Early Signal | Root Cause Pattern | Countermeasure |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------------|:---------------|
| stale context | inconsistent outputs | missing refresh window | enforce context TTL and refresh hooks |
| policy drift | unexpected execution | ad hoc overrides | centralize policy profiles |
| auth mismatch | 401/403 bursts | credential sprawl | rotation schedule + scope minimization |
| schema breakage | parser/validation errors | unmanaged upstream changes | contract tests per release |
| retry storms | queue congestion | no backoff controls | jittered backoff + circuit breakers |
| silent regressions | quality drop without alerts | weak baseline metrics | eval harness with thresholds |

### Implementation Runbook

1. Establish a reproducible baseline environment.
2. Capture chapter-specific success criteria before changes.
3. Implement minimal viable path with explicit interfaces.
4. Add observability before expanding feature scope.
5. Run deterministic tests for happy-path behavior.
6. Inject failure scenarios for negative-path validation.
7. Compare output quality against baseline snapshots.
8. Promote through staged environments with rollback gates.
9. Record operational lessons in release notes.
