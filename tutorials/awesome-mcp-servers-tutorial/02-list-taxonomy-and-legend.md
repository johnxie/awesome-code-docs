# Chapter 2: List Taxonomy and Legend

This chapter explains how to navigate the list's category structure and symbol legend for faster filtering.

## Learning Goals

- use category groupings to reduce search space quickly
- interpret language, scope, and OS symbols correctly
- separate discovery/navigation metadata from true production readiness
- avoid misclassification errors during server selection

## Taxonomy Strategy

The catalog groups servers by functional domain (for example, browser automation, databases, developer tools, and search). Treat categories as a first-pass relevance filter, then evaluate each repository directly.

The legend adds compact metadata:

- language markers (Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, and others)
- deployment scope markers (local versus cloud)
- platform compatibility markers (macOS, Windows, Linux)

## Practical Filtering Sequence

1. filter by business task or workflow objective
2. narrow by language/runtime constraints
3. narrow by scope constraints (local-only, cloud-only, or hybrid)
4. verify repository-level docs and installation quality

## Summary

You now have a consistent way to translate list taxonomy and symbols into practical shortlist decisions.
