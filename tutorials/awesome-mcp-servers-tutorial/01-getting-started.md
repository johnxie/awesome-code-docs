# Chapter 1: Getting Started

This chapter gives you a fast process for turning the list into an actionable shortlist for your current workflow.

## Learning Goals

- identify 3-5 candidate MCP servers aligned to a real task
- avoid over-installing overlapping servers early
- capture a minimal evaluation record before team rollout
- establish a repeatable first-pass review loop

## Quick Start Workflow

1. start with the [README](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers/blob/main/README.md) and identify the most relevant category
2. shortlist candidates with clear descriptions and active upstream repositories
3. validate host/client compatibility and local versus cloud fit
4. run one constrained proof task per server
5. keep only servers with measurable workflow lift and acceptable risk

## Starter Decision Table

| Decision Point | Fast Rule |
|:---------------|:----------|
| Category fit | pick servers in one category tied to a current bottleneck |
| Maintenance confidence | prefer recently updated repos with active issue triage |
| Scope | prefer narrower single-purpose tools before broad gateway tools |
| Rollout | promote to team stack only after repeatable local success |

## Summary

You now have a lean onboarding loop that turns a huge catalog into a practical pilot shortlist.
