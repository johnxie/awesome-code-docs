# Chapter 8: Team Adoption and Maintenance

This chapter packages the curation workflow into a durable team operating model.

## Learning Goals

- create a maintainable shared MCP server baseline
- align onboarding, validation, and upgrade processes across teams
- keep discoverability high with documented approved stacks
- reduce long-term tool sprawl and drift

## Team Operating Model

1. define a small approved starter stack by use case
2. publish a short internal rubric for new server requests
3. require pilot evidence before adding servers to the shared baseline
4. prune low-value or stale integrations on a fixed cadence

## Hand-off Artifacts

| Artifact | Purpose |
|:---------|:--------|
| approved server catalog | standardize known-good integrations |
| setup runbook | reduce onboarding variance |
| risk register | document high-impact failure modes |
| deprecation log | track removals and replacements |
