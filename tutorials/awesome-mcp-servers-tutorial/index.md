## Why This Track Matters

`awesome-mcp-servers` is one of the largest and most actively maintained MCP discovery surfaces. It is a practical bridge between protocol-level MCP understanding and real server adoption decisions.

This track focuses on:

- navigating a very large server catalog without analysis paralysis
- evaluating server quality, security posture, and maintenance signals
- choosing installation and runtime patterns for local and cloud usage
- contributing high-quality list updates that keep signal high
