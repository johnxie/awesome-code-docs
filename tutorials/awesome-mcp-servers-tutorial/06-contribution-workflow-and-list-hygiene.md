# Chapter 6: Contribution Workflow and List Hygiene

This chapter explains how to contribute entries that preserve catalog quality and maintainability.

## Learning Goals

- follow repository contribution expectations precisely
- keep formatting and ordering consistent with existing style
- improve discoverability without adding noisy or duplicate entries
- package pull requests for fast maintainer review

## Contribution Practices

The repository contribution guide emphasizes consistency and signal quality:

- edit `README.md` with clear one-line entry descriptions
- keep entries in alphabetical order within each category
- verify links and category placement before submitting
- scope pull requests to focused, reviewable changes

## Contributor Checklist

1. verify the candidate server is active and relevant
2. confirm the category is correct or create one only when necessary
3. ensure naming and description style matches neighboring entries
4. re-check links and formatting before opening the PR
