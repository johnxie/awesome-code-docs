## Why This Track Matters

Aider is one of the most widely used terminal-first coding agents. It is powerful because it edits real files in real repositories, but that means workflow discipline matters.

This track focuses on:

- precise prompting for deterministic edits
- safe multi-file and git-aware workflows
- model configuration for quality/cost tradeoffs
- practical habits that reduce rework and regressions
