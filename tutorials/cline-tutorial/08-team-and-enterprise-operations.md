# Chapter 8: Team and Enterprise Operations

This chapter covers how to run Cline consistently across teams with policy, observability, and incident readiness.

## Team Standardization

| Standard | Why It Matters |
|:---------|:---------------|
| shared task prompt template | consistent execution quality |
| repo-level command catalog | predictable validation behavior |
| review threshold policy | prevents risky autonomous changes |
| tool allowlist ownership | clear governance boundaries |

## Enterprise Control Plane

- identity federation and role-based access
- policy-managed command/tool restrictions
- centralized task and action audit logs
- environment segmentation (dev/stage/prod)

## Incident Runbook Signals

Track and alert on:

- sudden command failure spikes
- repeated provider/model errors
- anomalous tool invocation patterns
- rising mean cost per completed task

## Final Summary

You now have an operational model for scaling Cline from individual workflows to governed organizational deployment.
