## What Is Flowise?

Flowise is an open-source visual workflow builder for LLM applications. It provides a drag-and-drop canvas for connecting AI models, data sources, and tools into production-ready pipelines — without writing boilerplate code.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Visual Canvas** | Drag-and-drop workflow builder with real-time preview |
| **Node Library** | 100+ pre-built nodes for LLMs, tools, and data sources |
| **Streaming** | Real-time streaming responses with SSE |
| **Multi-Model** | OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, HuggingFace, Ollama |
| **Custom Nodes** | Extensible architecture for building custom integrations |
| **API Export** | Auto-generated REST APIs for every workflow |
