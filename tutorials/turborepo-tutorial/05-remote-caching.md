# Chapter 5: Remote Caching

Set up team-wide caching to share build artifacts across your organization and CI/CD pipelines.

## Remote Cache Setup

### Vercel Integration

turbo link
```

### Custom Remote Cache

```bash
# Environment variables
TURBO_REMOTE_CACHE_DISABLED=false
TURBO_API=https://my-cache-server.com
TURBO_TOKEN=your-api-token
```

## Team Benefits

### Faster Builds

- Share cache across team members
- CI/CD pipeline acceleration
- Reduced build times

### Consistency

- Same cache for all environments
- Reproducible builds
- Debugging consistency

## Next Steps
