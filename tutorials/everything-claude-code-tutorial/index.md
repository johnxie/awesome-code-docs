## Why This Track Matters

`everything-claude-code` is one of the largest open-source Claude Code configuration collections and a practical reference for running AI-assisted engineering loops with stronger discipline.

This track focuses on:

- reliable plugin install and rules setup
- understanding the full component stack (agents, skills, hooks, commands, MCP)
- adopting verification, learning, and orchestration patterns
- operating the stack safely across multiple toolchains
