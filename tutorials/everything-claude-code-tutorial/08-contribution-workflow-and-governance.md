# Chapter 8: Contribution Workflow and Governance

This chapter explains how to contribute new components while preserving quality and consistency.

## Learning Goals

- contribute agents, skills, hooks, and commands with proper structure
- follow PR quality expectations and testing checklists
- maintain compatibility across ecosystem targets
- enforce governance for long-term maintainability

## Contribution Flow

1. pick a focused contribution type
2. follow folder/template conventions
3. test locally and in Claude Code runtime
4. submit PR with clear summary and verification

## Governance Priorities

- consistent naming and structure
- high-signal documentation for every new component
- backward compatibility where possible
- explicit deprecation notes when behavior changes

## Source References

- [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [README Contribution Section](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/blob/main/README.md#-contributing)
- [Releases](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/releases)

## Summary

You now have an end-to-end model for adopting and contributing to Everything Claude Code.

Next steps:

- establish a team baseline command/skill stack
- codify verification gates for all workflow changes
- contribute one focused component with tests and docs
