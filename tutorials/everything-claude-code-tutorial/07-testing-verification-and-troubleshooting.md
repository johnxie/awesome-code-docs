# Chapter 7: Testing, Verification, and Troubleshooting

This chapter provides quality and incident-response routines.

## Learning Goals

- run test and verification loops consistently
- diagnose hook, rules, and command failures quickly
- maintain stable runtime behavior during rapid changes
- prevent repeated regressions in workflow assets

## Reliability Routine

- run tests and verification after major updates
- check hook firing sequence on representative tasks
- inspect command output drift after component changes
- capture recurring failures as explicit playbook notes

## Source References
