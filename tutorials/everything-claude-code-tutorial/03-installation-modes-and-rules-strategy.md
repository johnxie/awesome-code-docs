# Chapter 3: Installation Modes and Rules Strategy

This chapter covers installation choices and language-rule management.

## Learning Goals

- choose plugin install vs manual install intentionally
- configure common plus language-specific rules safely
- avoid rule bloat across mixed-language projects
- maintain consistent setup across contributors

## Installation Paths

- plugin install (recommended for most users)
- manual copy/sync of components (advanced customization)

## Rules Strategy

- always install common rules
- add only language sets you actively use
- version rule sets with project onboarding docs

## Source References

- [README Installation](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/blob/main/README.md#-installation)
- [Rules README](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/blob/main/rules/README.md)
- [Plugin Manifest Notes](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/blob/main/.claude-plugin/README.md)
