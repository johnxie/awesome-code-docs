# Chapter 6: Cross-Platform Workflows (Cursor and OpenCode)

This chapter covers portability patterns across editor and agent runtimes.

## Learning Goals

- apply Cursor and OpenCode integration paths correctly
- understand feature parity and known differences
- avoid portability regressions in shared teams
- keep one conceptual workflow across multiple tools

## Portability Guidelines

- keep core commands and skills semantically aligned
- document runtime-specific differences explicitly
- test a small reference workflow in each target environment

## Source References

- [Cursor Support](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/blob/main/.cursor/README.md)
- [OpenCode Support](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/blob/main/.opencode/README.md)
- [README OpenCode Section](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/blob/main/README.md#-opencode-support)

## Summary

You now have a practical cross-platform portability model.
