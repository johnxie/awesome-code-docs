# Chapter 5: Hooks, MCP, and Continuous Learning Loops

This chapter explains automation and feedback loops that improve over time.

## Learning Goals

- understand hook lifecycle behavior and guardrails
- configure MCP integrations for external capabilities
- use continuous learning skills without polluting context
- establish safe automation boundaries

## Hook and MCP Role Split

- hooks: event-based local automation
- MCP: external tool/data integrations
- skills: durable workflow intelligence

## Continuous Learning Baseline

- capture reusable patterns from sessions
- score confidence before promoting patterns
- evolve into skills only after repeated evidence

## Source References

- [README Continuous Learning](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/blob/main/README.md#-continuous-learning-v2)

## Summary

You now understand how to run automated feedback loops with controlled risk.
