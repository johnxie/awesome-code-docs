# Chapter 8: Contribution Workflow and Production Governance

This chapter closes with contribution and governance patterns for team adoption.

## Learning Goals

- separate experimental and production usage paths
- preserve auditability and rollback capability

## Governance Checklist

- track environment and model config per deployment
- enforce secure key handling and runtime isolation
