# Chapter 6: CLI Operations and Provider Strategy

This chapter covers operational patterns for running AutoAgent day-to-day.

## Learning Goals

- run CLI commands with consistent parameters
- switch providers intentionally by task profile
- monitor execution reliability across models
- reduce operational surprises in multi-provider runs

## Operational Priorities

- pin preferred completion model per workload class
- document provider fallbacks and failure policy
- keep runtime flags explicit in automation scripts

## Source References

- [AutoAgent README: CLI Mode](https://github.com/HKUDS/AutoAgent/blob/main/README.md)
- [User Guide Daily Tasks](https://github.com/HKUDS/AutoAgent/blob/main/docs/docs/User-Guideline/user-guide-daily-tasks.md)

## Summary

You now have a repeatable operations model for AutoAgent CLI workflows.
