# Chapter 4: Agent and Workflow Creation Patterns

This chapter focuses on effective natural-language prompts for agent and workflow generation.

## Learning Goals

- write clearer creation prompts for better outputs
- separate capability requirements from implementation details
- iterate profile/tool/workflow outputs with intent clarity
- avoid over-specified or under-specified requests

## Creation Strategy

- define goal, constraints, and success criteria first
- iterate in small prompt revisions
- validate generated agents on representative tasks

## Source References

- [User Guide: Create Agent](https://autoagent-ai.github.io/docs/user-guide-how-to-create-agent)
- [Developer Guide: Build Project](https://github.com/HKUDS/AutoAgent/blob/main/docs/docs/Dev-Guideline/dev-guide-build-your-project.md)

## Summary

You now have prompt patterns for more reliable AutoAgent creation flows.
