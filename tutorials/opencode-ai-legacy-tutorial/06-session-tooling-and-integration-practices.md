# Chapter 6: Session, Tooling, and Integration Practices

This chapter explains session continuity and integration hygiene in legacy systems.

## Learning Goals

- manage session persistence and compaction behavior
- configure MCP and LSP integrations conservatively
- avoid tool sprawl in archived environments
- maintain clear audit trails for legacy runs

## Integration Guidance

- keep MCP server list minimal and trusted
- document LSP dependencies explicitly
- monitor compaction effects on long-running sessions

## Source References

- [OpenCode AI README: Auto Compact](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode/blob/main/README.md)
- [OpenCode AI README: MCP/LSP Config Sections](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode/blob/main/README.md)

## Summary

You now have stable session and integration practices for controlled legacy operation.
