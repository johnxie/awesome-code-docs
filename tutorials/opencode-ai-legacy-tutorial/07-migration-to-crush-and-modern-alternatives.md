# Chapter 7: Migration to Crush and Modern Alternatives

This chapter provides a migration framework from archived OpenCode AI to maintained tools.

## Learning Goals

- map feature parity and gaps between legacy and successor
- define migration phases and rollback plans
- preserve critical workflows during transition
- reduce risk from long-lived legacy dependencies

## Migration Template

1. inventory current legacy workflows and dependencies
2. pilot equivalent flows in Crush
3. run dual-track validation with acceptance criteria
4. cut over incrementally and freeze legacy surface

## Summary

You now have a practical migration path away from archived OpenCode AI infrastructure.
