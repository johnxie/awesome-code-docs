# Chapter 4: Model Providers and Runtime Operations

This chapter covers model/provider routing and runtime controls in legacy mode.

## Learning Goals

- configure provider credentials and fallback paths
- map model choice to task quality/latency needs
- constrain shell/tool runtime behavior safely
- document environment assumptions for repeatability

## Runtime Considerations

- keep provider keys scoped and rotated
- pin model IDs used in legacy automation
- validate shell config and command safety boundaries

## Source References

- [OpenCode AI README: Environment Variables](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode/blob/main/README.md)
- [OpenCode AI README: Supported Models](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode/blob/main/README.md)

## Summary

You now have a stable runtime configuration model for legacy operations.
