# Chapter 1: Getting Started and Project Status

This chapter sets expectations for working with an archived repository.

## Learning Goals

- confirm archive/migration status before adoption
- identify valid use cases for legacy operation
- avoid treating archived defaults as production-ready
- define ownership if you must maintain a fork

## Status Note

The repository is archived and points users to Crush for active development. Treat OpenCode AI primarily as a reference or controlled legacy dependency.

## Source References

- [OpenCode AI README](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode/blob/main/README.md)
- [Crush Successor Repository](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush)

## Summary

You now have the right baseline context for responsible legacy usage.
