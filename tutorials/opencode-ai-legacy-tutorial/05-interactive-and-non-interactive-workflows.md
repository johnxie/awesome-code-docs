# Chapter 5: Interactive and Non-Interactive Workflows

This chapter maps operator workflows for both TUI and scripted usage.

## Learning Goals

- run interactive sessions for exploratory tasks
- run prompt-mode automation for scripted tasks
- choose output formats for downstream tooling
- avoid unstable assumptions in unattended runs

## Workflow Patterns

- interactive TUI for high-context iterative sessions
- non-interactive prompt mode for CI/scripting glue
- JSON output mode for structured integrations

## Source References

- [OpenCode AI README: Usage](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode/blob/main/README.md)
- [OpenCode AI README: Non-Interactive Prompt Mode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode/blob/main/README.md)

## Summary

You now can operate legacy OpenCode in both manual and scripted workflows.
