# Chapter 8: Legacy Governance and Controlled Sunset

This chapter covers governance patterns for responsibly retiring legacy agent stacks.

## Learning Goals

- enforce ownership and review gates for legacy usage
- define sunset milestones and deadlines
- monitor residual risk until full decommission
- preserve historical context for auditability

## Sunset Checklist

- freeze feature work on legacy stack
- allow only security/critical fixes
- migrate all automated pipelines first
- decommission runtime keys and infra after cutover
