# Chapter 2: Legacy Architecture and Feature Model

This chapter reviews the core product model to preserve useful patterns.

## Learning Goals

- understand TUI-first terminal architecture
- map session/tool/model capabilities
- identify still-useful interaction patterns
- distinguish reusable ideas from legacy constraints

## Architecture Highlights

- Bubble Tea-based interactive terminal UX
- multi-provider model support with configurable agents
- local session persistence and context compaction features

## Source References

- [OpenCode AI README](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode/blob/main/README.md)
- [OpenCode AI Source Tree](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode)

## Summary

You now understand what parts of the legacy architecture remain worth carrying forward.
