# Chapter 3: Installation and Configuration Baseline

This chapter covers reproducible legacy setup for controlled environments.

## Learning Goals

- install legacy binaries and scripts safely
- configure environment and JSON settings deterministically
- document exact versions for reproducibility
- reduce setup drift across operators

## Setup Guidance

- pin known working release version
- store config templates with environment assumptions
- isolate legacy runtime from modern critical paths

## Source References

- [OpenCode AI Install Script](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode/blob/main/install)
- [OpenCode AI Release v0.0.55](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode/releases/tag/v0.0.55)
- [OpenCode AI README: Configuration](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode/blob/main/README.md)

## Summary

You now have a reproducible setup baseline for legacy OpenCode operation.
