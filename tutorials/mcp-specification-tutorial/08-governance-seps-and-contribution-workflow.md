# Chapter 8: Governance, SEPs, and Contribution Workflow

Protocol-level quality depends on governance clarity and disciplined proposal workflows.

## Learning Goals

- understand maintainer roles and decision boundaries
- use SEP workflow to propose non-trivial protocol changes
- map roadmap priorities to your internal adoption strategy
- contribute docs/schema updates in a review-friendly way

## Governance and Change Workflow

1. validate problem fit in community channels and working groups
2. prototype and gather evidence before drafting a SEP
3. follow SEP format and sponsorship expectations
4. update schema/docs with generated artifacts and cross-links
5. ship protocol changes with migration notes and compatibility testing

## Long-Term Adoption Strategy

- monitor roadmap priority themes (async ops, statelessness, identity, registry GA)
- maintain an internal compatibility matrix across spec revisions and SDK versions
- allocate capacity for security-impacting changes separately from feature work
- treat governance/process updates as operational requirements, not only community context

## Summary

You now have a governance-aware operating model for shipping MCP changes and tracking protocol evolution over time.
