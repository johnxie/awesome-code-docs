# Chapter 6: MCP Integration Patterns

Cipher can run as an MCP server and expose tools to clients like Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and others.

## Integration Dimensions

- transport type: stdio, SSE, streamable-HTTP
- server mode: default vs aggregator
- environment export requirements in MCP mode

## Source References

- [MCP integration docs](https://github.com/campfirein/cipher/blob/main/docs/mcp-integration.md)
- [Examples docs](https://github.com/campfirein/cipher/blob/main/docs/examples.md)

## Summary

You now have a practical map for integrating Cipher with MCP clients under different transport and mode constraints.
