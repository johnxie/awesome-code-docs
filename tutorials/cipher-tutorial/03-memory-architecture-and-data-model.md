# Chapter 3: Memory Architecture and Data Model

Cipher captures and retrieves coding memory across interactions, including knowledge and reasoning patterns.

## Memory Layers

| Layer | Purpose |
|:------|:--------|
| knowledge memory | reusable facts and implementation context |
| reasoning/reflection memory | higher-order reasoning traces and patterns |
| workspace memory | team/project-scoped shared context |

## Source References

- [Built-in tools docs](https://github.com/campfirein/cipher/blob/main/docs/builtin-tools.md)

## Summary

You now understand the high-level memory model that powers Cipher across agent interactions.
