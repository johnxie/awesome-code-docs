# Chapter 4: Permissions and Tool Controls

Welcome to **Chapter 4: Permissions and Tool Controls**. In this part of **Crush Tutorial: Multi-Model Terminal Coding Agent with Strong Extensibility**, you will build an intuitive mental model first, then move into concrete implementation details and practical production tradeoffs.


This chapter covers how to define safe execution boundaries without killing productivity.

## Learning Goals

- set explicit tool-permission policies in Crush
- constrain high-risk tools and commands
- understand `--yolo` mode risks
- use ignore rules to reduce accidental context exposure

## Permission Controls

| Control | Location | Purpose |
|:--------|:---------|:--------|
| `permissions.allowed_tools` | config | allow safe tools to run without repeated prompts |
| `options.disabled_tools` | config | fully hide high-risk or irrelevant built-in tools |
| `disabled_tools` under MCP configs | config | disable specific MCP-exposed tools |
| `--yolo` | CLI flag | bypass prompts; use only in trusted environments |

## Practical Safety Baseline

1. default to prompts for write/destructive actions
2. disable tools not required for your current task class
3. use `.crushignore` to exclude large/noisy/sensitive paths
4. reserve `--yolo` for disposable sandboxes

## Summary

You now have a practical control model for balancing Crush autonomy and safety.

## Depth Expansion Playbook

This chapter is expanded to v1-style depth for production-grade learning and implementation quality.

### Strategic Context

- tutorial: **Crush Tutorial: Multi-Model Terminal Coding Agent with Strong Extensibility**
- tutorial slug: **crush-tutorial**
- chapter focus: **Chapter 4: Permissions and Tool Controls**
- system context: **Crush Tutorial**
- objective: move from surface-level usage to repeatable engineering operation

### Architecture Decomposition

1. Define the runtime boundary for `Chapter 4: Permissions and Tool Controls`.
2. Separate control-plane decisions from data-plane execution.
3. Capture input contracts, transformation points, and output contracts.
4. Trace state transitions across request lifecycle stages.
5. Identify extension hooks and policy interception points.
6. Map ownership boundaries for team and automation workflows.
7. Specify rollback and recovery paths for unsafe changes.
8. Track observability signals for correctness, latency, and cost.

### Operator Decision Matrix

| Decision Area | Low-Risk Path | High-Control Path | Tradeoff |
|:--------------|:--------------|:------------------|:---------|
| Runtime mode | managed defaults | explicit policy config | speed vs control |
| State handling | local ephemeral | durable persisted state | simplicity vs auditability |
| Tool integration | direct API use | mediated adapter layer | velocity vs governance |
| Rollout method | manual change | staged + canary rollout | effort vs safety |
| Incident response | best effort logs | runbooks + SLO alerts | cost vs reliability |

### Failure Modes and Countermeasures

| Failure Mode | Early Signal | Root Cause Pattern | Countermeasure |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------------|:---------------|
| stale context | inconsistent outputs | missing refresh window | enforce context TTL and refresh hooks |
| policy drift | unexpected execution | ad hoc overrides | centralize policy profiles |
| auth mismatch | 401/403 bursts | credential sprawl | rotation schedule + scope minimization |
| schema breakage | parser/validation errors | unmanaged upstream changes | contract tests per release |
| retry storms | queue congestion | no backoff controls | jittered backoff + circuit breakers |
| silent regressions | quality drop without alerts | weak baseline metrics | eval harness with thresholds |

### Implementation Runbook

1. Establish a reproducible baseline environment.
2. Capture chapter-specific success criteria before changes.
3. Implement minimal viable path with explicit interfaces.
4. Add observability before expanding feature scope.
5. Run deterministic tests for happy-path behavior.
6. Inject failure scenarios for negative-path validation.
7. Compare output quality against baseline snapshots.
8. Promote through staged environments with rollback gates.
9. Record operational lessons in release notes.

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Most teams struggle here because the hard part is not writing more code, but deciding clear boundaries for core abstractions in this chapter so behavior stays predictable as complexity grows.

In practical terms, this chapter helps you avoid three common failures:

- coupling core logic too tightly to one implementation path
- missing the handoff boundaries between setup, execution, and validation
- shipping changes without clear rollback or observability strategy

After working through this chapter, you should be able to reason about `Chapter 4: Permissions and Tool Controls` as an operating subsystem inside **Crush Tutorial: Multi-Model Terminal Coding Agent with Strong Extensibility**, with explicit contracts for inputs, state transitions, and outputs.

Use the implementation notes around execution and reliability details as your checklist when adapting these patterns to your own repository.

## How it Works Under the Hood

Under the hood, `Chapter 4: Permissions and Tool Controls` usually follows a repeatable control path:

1. **Context bootstrap**: initialize runtime config and prerequisites for `core component`.
2. **Input normalization**: shape incoming data so `execution layer` receives stable contracts.
3. **Core execution**: run the main logic branch and propagate intermediate state through `state model`.
4. **Policy and safety checks**: enforce limits, auth scopes, and failure boundaries.
5. **Output composition**: return canonical result payloads for downstream consumers.
6. **Operational telemetry**: emit logs/metrics needed for debugging and performance tuning.

When debugging, walk this sequence in order and confirm each stage has explicit success/failure conditions.
