# Chapter 1: Getting Started

Welcome to **Chapter 1: Getting Started**. In this part of **Crush Tutorial: Multi-Model Terminal Coding Agent with Strong Extensibility**, you will build an intuitive mental model first, then move into concrete implementation details and practical production tradeoffs.


This chapter gets Crush installed and ready for real coding work in minutes.

## Learning Goals

- install Crush using your preferred platform path
- authenticate a provider and run first prompt
- validate session baseline in a local project
- fix common startup misconfigurations quickly

## Installation Paths

| Path | Command | Best For |
|:-----|:--------|:---------|
| Homebrew | `brew install charmbracelet/tap/crush` | macOS/Linux package-managed setup |
| NPM | `npm install -g @charmland/crush` | Node-centric environments |
| Winget | `winget install charmbracelet.crush` | Windows environments |
| Go install | `go install github.com/charmbracelet/crush@latest` | Go-native toolchain users |

## First Run Checklist

1. launch `crush`
2. configure provider credentials when prompted (or set env vars first)
3. open a project directory and ask for a scoped code task
4. verify tool calls and file operations behave as expected

## Quick Environment Baseline

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
# or OPENAI_API_KEY, OPENROUTER_API_KEY, etc.
crush
```

## Common Startup Issues

| Symptom | Cause | First Fix |
|:--------|:------|:----------|
| provider not available | missing env var | set provider key and restart Crush |
| unstable output quality | model mismatch for coding tasks | switch to coding-optimized model |
| unexpected filesystem actions | loose permissions/tool policy | set explicit permission controls in config |

## Depth Expansion Playbook

<!-- depth-expansion-v2 -->

This chapter is expanded to v1-style depth for production-grade learning and implementation quality.

### Strategic Context

- tutorial: **Crush Tutorial: Multi-Model Terminal Coding Agent with Strong Extensibility**
- tutorial slug: **crush-tutorial**
- chapter focus: **Chapter 1: Getting Started**
- system context: **Crush Tutorial**
- objective: move from surface-level usage to repeatable engineering operation

### Architecture Decomposition

1. Define the runtime boundary for `Chapter 1: Getting Started`.
2. Separate control-plane decisions from data-plane execution.
3. Capture input contracts, transformation points, and output contracts.
4. Trace state transitions across request lifecycle stages.
5. Identify extension hooks and policy interception points.
6. Map ownership boundaries for team and automation workflows.
7. Specify rollback and recovery paths for unsafe changes.
8. Track observability signals for correctness, latency, and cost.

### Operator Decision Matrix

| Decision Area | Low-Risk Path | High-Control Path | Tradeoff |
|:--------------|:--------------|:------------------|:---------|
| Runtime mode | managed defaults | explicit policy config | speed vs control |
| State handling | local ephemeral | durable persisted state | simplicity vs auditability |
| Tool integration | direct API use | mediated adapter layer | velocity vs governance |
| Rollout method | manual change | staged + canary rollout | effort vs safety |
| Incident response | best effort logs | runbooks + SLO alerts | cost vs reliability |

### Failure Modes and Countermeasures

| Failure Mode | Early Signal | Root Cause Pattern | Countermeasure |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------------|:---------------|
| stale context | inconsistent outputs | missing refresh window | enforce context TTL and refresh hooks |
| policy drift | unexpected execution | ad hoc overrides | centralize policy profiles |
| auth mismatch | 401/403 bursts | credential sprawl | rotation schedule + scope minimization |
| schema breakage | parser/validation errors | unmanaged upstream changes | contract tests per release |
| retry storms | queue congestion | no backoff controls | jittered backoff + circuit breakers |
| silent regressions | quality drop without alerts | weak baseline metrics | eval harness with thresholds |

### Implementation Runbook

1. Establish a reproducible baseline environment.
2. Capture chapter-specific success criteria before changes.
3. Implement minimal viable path with explicit interfaces.
4. Add observability before expanding feature scope.
5. Run deterministic tests for happy-path behavior.
6. Inject failure scenarios for negative-path validation.
7. Compare output quality against baseline snapshots.
8. Promote through staged environments with rollback gates.
9. Record operational lessons in release notes.

### Quality Gate Checklist

- [ ] chapter-level assumptions are explicit and testable
- [ ] API/tool boundaries are documented with input/output examples
- [ ] failure handling includes retry, timeout, and fallback policy
- [ ] security controls include auth scopes and secret rotation plans

### Advanced Practice Exercises

1. Build a minimal end-to-end implementation for `Chapter 1: Getting Started`.
2. Add instrumentation and measure baseline latency and error rate.
3. Introduce one controlled failure and confirm graceful recovery.
4. Add policy constraints and verify they are enforced consistently.
5. Run a staged rollout and document rollback decision criteria.

### Review Questions

1. Which execution boundary matters most for this chapter and why?
2. What signal detects regressions earliest in your environment?
3. What tradeoff did you make between delivery speed and governance?
4. How would you recover from the highest-impact failure mode?
5. What must be automated before scaling to team-wide adoption?

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Most teams struggle here because the hard part is not writing more code, but deciding clear boundaries for `crush` so behavior stays predictable as complexity grows.

In practical terms, this chapter helps you avoid three common failures:

- coupling core logic too tightly to one implementation path
- missing the handoff boundaries between setup, execution, and validation
- shipping changes without clear rollback or observability strategy

After working through this chapter, you should be able to reason about `Chapter 1: Getting Started` as an operating subsystem inside **Crush Tutorial: Multi-Model Terminal Coding Agent with Strong Extensibility**, with explicit contracts for inputs, state transitions, and outputs.

Use the implementation notes around execution and reliability details as your checklist when adapting these patterns to your own repository.

## How it Works Under the Hood

Under the hood, `Chapter 1: Getting Started` usually follows a repeatable control path:

1. **Context bootstrap**: initialize runtime config and prerequisites for `crush`.
2. **Input normalization**: shape incoming data so `execution layer` receives stable contracts.
3. **Core execution**: run the main logic branch and propagate intermediate state through `state model`.
4. **Policy and safety checks**: enforce limits, auth scopes, and failure boundaries.
5. **Output composition**: return canonical result payloads for downstream consumers.
6. **Operational telemetry**: emit logs/metrics needed for debugging and performance tuning.

When debugging, walk this sequence in order and confirm each stage has explicit success/failure conditions.

Suggested trace strategy:
- search upstream code for `crush` and `crush` to map concrete implementation paths
- compare docs claims against actual runtime/config code before reusing patterns in production
