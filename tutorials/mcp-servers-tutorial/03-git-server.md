# Chapter 3: Git Server

Welcome to **Chapter 3: Git Server**. In this part of **MCP Servers Tutorial: Reference Implementations and Patterns**, you will build an intuitive mental model first, then move into concrete implementation details and practical production tradeoffs.


The git server demonstrates a practical balance between read-heavy analysis and controlled mutation.

## Core Tool Surface

The reference git server supports:

- repository state checks (`git_status`, diffs, logs)
- staging and commit operations
- branch creation and checkout
- commit inspection (`git_show`)

This mirrors common developer assistant workflows.

## Safe Usage Strategy

Start with read-only operations:

1. status
2. unstaged/staged diff
3. log and branch listing

Then enable mutating operations (`git_add`, `git_commit`, checkout/reset) only after adding explicit policy controls.

## Mutation Guardrails

For production adaptation, add:

- branch protections
- commit message policy checks
- allowlisted repo paths
- signer identity and audit logging

Without these controls, an agent can perform valid git operations that still violate team policy.

## Example Interaction Pattern

```text
analyze changes -> propose patch -> stage selected files -> commit with structured message
```

Split reasoning and execution. Force explicit confirmation between analysis and mutation steps.

## Common Failure Modes

| Failure | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|:--------|:-----------|:-----------|
| Wrong repository targeted | Ambiguous `repo_path` | Resolve canonical path and verify allowlist |
| Overscoped staging | Wildcard or broad file selection | Enforce explicit file list |
| Unsafe branch switch | Dirty working tree | Add pre-check and block on conflicts |
| Undocumented commit semantics | Inconsistent agent behavior | Standardize commit message template |

## Summary

You can now treat git server operations as a controllable pipeline instead of ad-hoc commands.

Next: [Chapter 4: Memory Server](04-memory-server.md)

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Most teams struggle here because the hard part is not writing more code, but deciding clear boundaries for `analyze`, `changes`, `propose` so behavior stays predictable as complexity grows.

In practical terms, this chapter helps you avoid three common failures:

- coupling core logic too tightly to one implementation path
- missing the handoff boundaries between setup, execution, and validation
- shipping changes without clear rollback or observability strategy

After working through this chapter, you should be able to reason about `Chapter 3: Git Server` as an operating subsystem inside **MCP Servers Tutorial: Reference Implementations and Patterns**, with explicit contracts for inputs, state transitions, and outputs.

Use the implementation notes around `patch`, `stage`, `selected` as your checklist when adapting these patterns to your own repository.

## How it Works Under the Hood

Under the hood, `Chapter 3: Git Server` usually follows a repeatable control path:

1. **Context bootstrap**: initialize runtime config and prerequisites for `analyze`.
2. **Input normalization**: shape incoming data so `changes` receives stable contracts.
3. **Core execution**: run the main logic branch and propagate intermediate state through `propose`.
4. **Policy and safety checks**: enforce limits, auth scopes, and failure boundaries.
5. **Output composition**: return canonical result payloads for downstream consumers.
6. **Operational telemetry**: emit logs/metrics needed for debugging and performance tuning.

When debugging, walk this sequence in order and confirm each stage has explicit success/failure conditions.

## Source Walkthrough

Use the following upstream sources to verify implementation details while reading this chapter:

- [MCP servers repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)
  Why it matters: authoritative reference on `MCP servers repository` (github.com).

Suggested trace strategy:
- search upstream code for `analyze` and `changes` to map concrete implementation paths
- compare docs claims against actual runtime/config code before reusing patterns in production

### Strategic Context

- tutorial: **MCP Servers Tutorial: Reference Implementations and Patterns**
- tutorial slug: **mcp-servers-tutorial**
- chapter focus: **Chapter 3: Git Server**
- system context: **Mcp Servers Tutorial**
- objective: move from surface-level usage to repeatable engineering operation

### Architecture Decomposition

1. Define the runtime boundary for `Chapter 3: Git Server`.
2. Separate control-plane decisions from data-plane execution.
3. Capture input contracts, transformation points, and output contracts.
4. Trace state transitions across request lifecycle stages.
5. Identify extension hooks and policy interception points.
6. Map ownership boundaries for team and automation workflows.
7. Specify rollback and recovery paths for unsafe changes.
8. Track observability signals for correctness, latency, and cost.

### Operator Decision Matrix

| Decision Area | Low-Risk Path | High-Control Path | Tradeoff |
|:--------------|:--------------|:------------------|:---------|
| Runtime mode | managed defaults | explicit policy config | speed vs control |
| State handling | local ephemeral | durable persisted state | simplicity vs auditability |
| Tool integration | direct API use | mediated adapter layer | velocity vs governance |
| Rollout method | manual change | staged + canary rollout | effort vs safety |
| Incident response | best effort logs | runbooks + SLO alerts | cost vs reliability |

### Failure Modes and Countermeasures

| Failure Mode | Early Signal | Root Cause Pattern | Countermeasure |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------------|:---------------|
| stale context | inconsistent outputs | missing refresh window | enforce context TTL and refresh hooks |
| policy drift | unexpected execution | ad hoc overrides | centralize policy profiles |
| auth mismatch | 401/403 bursts | credential sprawl | rotation schedule + scope minimization |
| schema breakage | parser/validation errors | unmanaged upstream changes | contract tests per release |
| retry storms | queue congestion | no backoff controls | jittered backoff + circuit breakers |
| silent regressions | quality drop without alerts | weak baseline metrics | eval harness with thresholds |

### Implementation Runbook

1. Establish a reproducible baseline environment.
2. Capture chapter-specific success criteria before changes.
3. Implement minimal viable path with explicit interfaces.
4. Add observability before expanding feature scope.
5. Run deterministic tests for happy-path behavior.
6. Inject failure scenarios for negative-path validation.
7. Compare output quality against baseline snapshots.
8. Promote through staged environments with rollback gates.
9. Record operational lessons in release notes.
