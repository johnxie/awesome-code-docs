# Chapter 4: Memory Server

Memory servers store entities and relationships for persistent context across sessions.

## Core Model

- **Entities**: people, systems, projects, concepts
- **Relations**: ownership, dependency, similarity, chronology
- **Attributes**: metadata used for retrieval and ranking

## Retrieval Pattern

1. Query by entity and tags.
2. Expand related nodes.
3. Rank for relevance.
4. Return compact context bundle.

## Use Cases

- Long-running project assistants.
- Knowledge graph-backed support workflows.
- Cross-session memory for agent handoffs.

## Summary

You can now map memory-server behavior to practical knowledge workflows.
