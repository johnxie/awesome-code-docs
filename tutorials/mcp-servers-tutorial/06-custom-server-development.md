# Chapter 6: Custom Server Development

Welcome to **Chapter 6: Custom Server Development**. In this part of **MCP Servers Tutorial: Reference Implementations and Patterns**, you will build an intuitive mental model first, then move into concrete implementation details and practical production tradeoffs.


This chapter turns reference patterns into your own server implementation approach.

## Build Sequence

Use this sequence instead of coding tools ad hoc:

1. Define tool contracts (inputs, outputs, error types).
2. Define authorization and side-effect policy.
3. Implement read-only tools first.
4. Add mutating tools with explicit confirmations.
5. Add observability hooks before rollout.

## Recommended Starting Point

Pick the closest reference server to your domain.

- file-centric automation -> filesystem
- repository workflows -> git
- conversational memory -> memory
- utility helpers -> time/fetch

Reuse structure, not just code snippets.

## Tool Contract Template

```text
name
purpose
input schema
output schema
idempotency behavior
destructive behavior
failure taxonomy
```

If this template is incomplete, production operation will likely be painful.

## Implementation Checklist

- Strict schema validation on input/output
- Deterministic error objects
- Timeouts and cancellation handling
- Bounded retries where safe
- Safe defaults for missing optional fields

## Verification Before Release

Run both protocol-level and behavior-level checks:

- protocol handshake and tool listing
- negative tests for malformed inputs
- side-effect tests in sandbox environments
- audit log completeness checks

## Summary

You now have a repeatable way to turn reference ideas into a maintainable custom MCP server.

Next: [Chapter 7: Security Considerations](07-security-considerations.md)

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Most teams struggle here because the hard part is not writing more code, but deciding clear boundaries for `schema`, `behavior`, `name` so behavior stays predictable as complexity grows.

In practical terms, this chapter helps you avoid three common failures:

- coupling core logic too tightly to one implementation path
- missing the handoff boundaries between setup, execution, and validation
- shipping changes without clear rollback or observability strategy

After working through this chapter, you should be able to reason about `Chapter 6: Custom Server Development` as an operating subsystem inside **MCP Servers Tutorial: Reference Implementations and Patterns**, with explicit contracts for inputs, state transitions, and outputs.

Use the implementation notes around `purpose`, `input`, `output` as your checklist when adapting these patterns to your own repository.

## How it Works Under the Hood

Under the hood, `Chapter 6: Custom Server Development` usually follows a repeatable control path:

1. **Context bootstrap**: initialize runtime config and prerequisites for `schema`.
2. **Input normalization**: shape incoming data so `behavior` receives stable contracts.
3. **Core execution**: run the main logic branch and propagate intermediate state through `name`.
4. **Policy and safety checks**: enforce limits, auth scopes, and failure boundaries.
5. **Output composition**: return canonical result payloads for downstream consumers.
6. **Operational telemetry**: emit logs/metrics needed for debugging and performance tuning.

When debugging, walk this sequence in order and confirm each stage has explicit success/failure conditions.

## Source Walkthrough

Use the following upstream sources to verify implementation details while reading this chapter:

- [MCP servers repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)
  Why it matters: authoritative reference on `MCP servers repository` (github.com).

Suggested trace strategy:
- search upstream code for `schema` and `behavior` to map concrete implementation paths
- compare docs claims against actual runtime/config code before reusing patterns in production

### Strategic Context

- tutorial: **MCP Servers Tutorial: Reference Implementations and Patterns**
- tutorial slug: **mcp-servers-tutorial**
- chapter focus: **Chapter 6: Custom Server Development**
- system context: **Mcp Servers Tutorial**
- objective: move from surface-level usage to repeatable engineering operation

### Architecture Decomposition

1. Define the runtime boundary for `Chapter 6: Custom Server Development`.
2. Separate control-plane decisions from data-plane execution.
3. Capture input contracts, transformation points, and output contracts.
4. Trace state transitions across request lifecycle stages.
5. Identify extension hooks and policy interception points.
6. Map ownership boundaries for team and automation workflows.
7. Specify rollback and recovery paths for unsafe changes.
8. Track observability signals for correctness, latency, and cost.

### Operator Decision Matrix

| Decision Area | Low-Risk Path | High-Control Path | Tradeoff |
|:--------------|:--------------|:------------------|:---------|
| Runtime mode | managed defaults | explicit policy config | speed vs control |
| State handling | local ephemeral | durable persisted state | simplicity vs auditability |
| Tool integration | direct API use | mediated adapter layer | velocity vs governance |
| Rollout method | manual change | staged + canary rollout | effort vs safety |
| Incident response | best effort logs | runbooks + SLO alerts | cost vs reliability |

### Failure Modes and Countermeasures

| Failure Mode | Early Signal | Root Cause Pattern | Countermeasure |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------------|:---------------|
| stale context | inconsistent outputs | missing refresh window | enforce context TTL and refresh hooks |
| policy drift | unexpected execution | ad hoc overrides | centralize policy profiles |
| auth mismatch | 401/403 bursts | credential sprawl | rotation schedule + scope minimization |
| schema breakage | parser/validation errors | unmanaged upstream changes | contract tests per release |
| retry storms | queue congestion | no backoff controls | jittered backoff + circuit breakers |
| silent regressions | quality drop without alerts | weak baseline metrics | eval harness with thresholds |

### Implementation Runbook

1. Establish a reproducible baseline environment.
2. Capture chapter-specific success criteria before changes.
3. Implement minimal viable path with explicit interfaces.
4. Add observability before expanding feature scope.
5. Run deterministic tests for happy-path behavior.
6. Inject failure scenarios for negative-path validation.
7. Compare output quality against baseline snapshots.
8. Promote through staged environments with rollback gates.
9. Record operational lessons in release notes.
