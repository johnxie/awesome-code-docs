# Chapter 5: Environments, Sandboxing, and Deployment

This chapter covers safe execution strategies across local and containerized environments.

## Learning Goals

- choose local vs containerized execution
- manage environment boundaries and permissions
- deploy with reproducible runtime assumptions
- reduce risk from arbitrary command execution

## Environment Strategy

- local environment for fast iteration
- containerized runtimes for isolation and reproducibility
- explicit filesystem and network policies in production-like runs

## Summary

You now have a safer deployment baseline for mini-swe-agent tasks.
