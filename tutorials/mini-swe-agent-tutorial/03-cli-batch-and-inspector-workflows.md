# Chapter 3: CLI, Batch, and Inspector Workflows

This chapter covers operating modes for local and benchmark tasks.

## Learning Goals

- run interactive CLI workflows efficiently
- execute batch swebench-style runs
- inspect trajectories for debugging and review
- choose mode based on workload requirements

## Workflow Modes

- `mini` CLI for direct task execution
- `swebench` mode for larger benchmark batches
- inspector tooling for trajectory analysis and failure review

- [SWE-bench Usage](https://mini-swe-agent.com/latest/usage/swebench/)
- [Inspector Usage](https://mini-swe-agent.com/latest/usage/inspector/)

## Summary

You now have a practical operating model for both interactive and benchmark runs.
