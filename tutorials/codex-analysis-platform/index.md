# Codex Analysis Platform Tutorial: Build Code Intelligence Systems

> Design and operate a production-grade code analysis platform with parsing, symbol resolution, code intelligence features, LSP integration, and rollout governance.

[![Category](https://img.shields.io/badge/category-code%20intelligence-blue)](../README.md)
[![Focus](https://img.shields.io/badge/focus-static%20analysis%20%2B%20developer%20tooling-green)](01-analysis-engine.md)

## Why This Track Matters

Most engineering teams rely on code intelligence features but do not understand how they are built or operated.

This track focuses on:

- architecture of multi-language analysis systems
- AST and symbol pipelines that power developer tooling
- practical LSP implementation patterns
- production rollout, governance, and CI automation

## Current Snapshot (auto-updated)

- tutorial scope: design and implementation patterns for code analysis platforms
- primary references: TypeScript Compiler API, Babel parser/traverse, Tree-sitter, and LSP specification
- chapter set includes architecture -> implementation -> operations
- structure and links validated by repository docs-health checks
