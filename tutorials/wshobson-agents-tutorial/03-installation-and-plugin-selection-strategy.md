# Chapter 3: Installation and Plugin Selection Strategy

This chapter shows how to choose plugin portfolios by objective instead of installing everything.

## Learning Goals

- select plugins by workflow goal and team constraints
- build phased installation plans for new teams
- avoid context bloat from uncontrolled plugin growth
- align plugin choices with quality and review practices

## Strategy Framework

1. Define your top three recurring workflows.
2. Map each workflow to one or two primary plugins.
3. Add one review/governance plugin.
4. Expand only when command gaps are verified.

## Example Portfolio Profiles

### Solo Full-Stack Engineer

- `backend-development`
- `frontend-mobile-development`
- `unit-testing`
- `code-review-ai`

### Platform Team

- `cloud-infrastructure`
- `kubernetes-operations`
- `cicd-automation`
- `security-scanning`

### Data/LLM Team

- `llm-application-dev`
- `data-engineering`
- `machine-learning-ops`
- `performance-testing-review`

## Anti-Patterns

- installing 20+ plugins before validating any workflow
- adding overlapping plugins without command-level rationale
- skipping review and security plugins in production-adjacent projects

## Summary

You now have a practical method for controlled plugin adoption.
