# OpenSkills Tutorial: Universal Skill Loading for Coding Agents

> Learn how to use `numman-ali/openskills` to install, synchronize, and operate reusable `SKILL.md` packs across Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Aider, and other agent environments.

## Why This Track Matters

Teams using multiple coding agents often duplicate skill prompts and lose consistency. OpenSkills provides a universal skill loader that keeps agent instructions portable and versionable.

This track focuses on:

- skill installation and synchronization workflows
- `AGENTS.md` integration patterns
- universal mode for multi-agent environments
- governance for shared skill libraries
