# Chapter 4: Sync and AGENTS.md Integration

`openskills sync` keeps `AGENTS.md` aligned with installed skills so agent clients can discover them.

## Integration Pattern

1. install/update skills
2. sync into `AGENTS.md`
3. verify `<available_skills>` entries
4. invoke with `openskills read <skill>`

## Summary

You now know how to keep skill metadata synchronized and discoverable.
