# Chapter 3: Projects and Session Management

This chapter focuses on Opcode's project browser and session control workflows.

## Learning Goals

- navigate project and session history efficiently
- resume prior sessions with context intact
- organize workflows for multiple repositories
- reduce context switching costs

## Workflow Path

```text
Projects -> Select Project -> View Sessions -> Resume or Start New
```

## Best Practices

- keep one active session per major objective
- name and group tasks at project level for clarity
- review session metadata before resuming old runs

- [Opcode README: Managing Projects](https://github.com/winfunc/opcode/blob/main/README.md#managing-projects)
