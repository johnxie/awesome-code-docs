# Opcode Tutorial: GUI Command Center for Claude Code Workflows

> Learn how to use `winfunc/opcode` to manage Claude Code projects, sessions, agents, MCP servers, and checkpoints from a desktop-first operating interface.

## Why This Track Matters

Opcode gives teams a visual layer on top of Claude Code sessions and agent workflows, which is valuable for tracking progress, coordinating work, and reducing terminal-only overhead.

This track focuses on:

- setting up Opcode and Claude Code together
- managing projects/sessions/agents from one dashboard
- using MCP and checkpoint features for safer iteration
- operating Opcode in secure, production-adjacent workflows
