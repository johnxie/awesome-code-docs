# Chapter 8: Production Operations and Governance

This chapter defines governance practices for stable long-term Cherry Studio operation.

## Learning Goals

- manage release/update channels safely
- maintain quality and incident response routines
- plan roadmap and adoption cycles with clear ownership

## Governance Baseline

|:-----|:---------------------|
| model governance | approved provider/model matrix by use case |
| assistant governance | reviewed prompt templates and role catalog |
| release governance | staged updates + rollback plan |
| operations | logging/monitoring and backup practices |
