# Chapter 6: Multi-Agent and Advanced Patterns

This chapter explores advanced usage beyond basic single-agent workflows.

## Learning Goals

- compose multiple agents for specialized workflows
- evaluate when to add streaming or autonomous patterns
- balance complexity with maintainability
- define escalation paths for human oversight

## Advanced Pattern Areas

- multi-agent decomposition by domain responsibility
- bidirectional streaming experiences for real-time interactions
- hybrid tool + MCP designs for broader capability coverage

## Summary

You now have a roadmap for scaling Strands workflows without losing architectural control.
