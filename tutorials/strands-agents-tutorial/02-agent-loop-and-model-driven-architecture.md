# Chapter 2: Agent Loop and Model-Driven Architecture

This chapter explains why Strands is described as model-driven and how that affects design choices.

## Learning Goals

- understand the core agent loop model
- map model reasoning to tool invocation behavior
- identify extension points for custom logic
- preserve simplicity while adding capability

## Architecture Notes

- the agent loop is intentionally lightweight
- models drive decision-making while tools execute capabilities
- APIs emphasize composable primitives instead of heavy framework layers

## Source References

- [Strands README](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python)
- [Strands Agent Loop Docs](https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/user-guide/concepts/agents/agent-loop/)
- [Strands Agent API Reference](https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/api-reference/python/agent/agent/)

## Summary

You now have the foundation to design Strands agents with clearer tradeoff awareness.
