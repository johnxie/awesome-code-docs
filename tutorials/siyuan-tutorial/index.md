# SiYuan Tutorial: Privacy-First Knowledge Management

> This tutorial is AI-generated! To learn more, check out [Awesome Code Docs](https://github.com/johnxie/awesome-code-docs)

SiYuan<sup>[View Repo](https://github.com/siyuan-note/siyuan)</sup> is a privacy-first personal knowledge management system that focuses on building a completely self-hosted, local-first knowledge base. Unlike cloud-based solutions, SiYuan gives you full control over your data while providing powerful features for organizing and connecting your thoughts.

SiYuan combines the best of note-taking apps with advanced features like block-based editing, bi-directional linking, and powerful query capabilities. It's designed for serious knowledge workers who value privacy and data ownership.
