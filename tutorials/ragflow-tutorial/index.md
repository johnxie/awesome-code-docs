## 🎯 What is RAGFlow?

**RAGFlow** is an open-source RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) engine designed for document-based question answering systems. It combines advanced document parsing, vector search, and large language models to create intelligent conversational interfaces that can answer questions based on your documents.

### Key Features
- 🔍 **Advanced Document Parsing** - Supports 100+ file formats
- 🧠 **Intelligent Chunking** - Automatic text segmentation and optimization
- 🔗 **Graph-Based Retrieval** - Knowledge graph enhanced search
- 🤖 **Multi-Model Support** - Integration with various LLMs
- 📊 **Visual Knowledge Management** - Graph visualization of knowledge
- 🚀 **High Performance** - Optimized for production deployment
- 🌐 **Web Interface** - User-friendly management console
