# Chapter 8: Production Team Operations

Successful team adoption of Claude Squad depends on clear process boundaries around session ownership, branch hygiene, and review controls.

## Operational Checklist

1. define per-session naming and ownership conventions
2. enforce branch review before merge from worktree outputs
3. limit AutoYes use to low-risk or tightly controlled contexts
4. standardize agent program defaults and environment variables
5. run periodic cleanup/reset of stale session/worktree state
