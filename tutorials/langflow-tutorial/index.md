## Why This Track Matters

Langflow is one of the largest open-source AI application platforms. It lets teams move quickly with visual authoring while still supporting code-level customization and production deployment paths.

This track focuses on:

- visual flow composition for agents and pipelines
- API and MCP deployment surfaces for workflow reuse
- observability/security baselines for production usage
- extension patterns through custom components

## Current Snapshot (auto-updated)

- repository: [`langflow-ai/langflow`](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow)
- stars: about **144.7k**
- latest release: [`1.7.3`](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/releases/tag/1.7.3)
- development activity: very active with same-day updates
