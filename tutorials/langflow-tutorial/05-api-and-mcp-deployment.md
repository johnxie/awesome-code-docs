# Chapter 5: API and MCP Deployment

Langflow can expose workflows as APIs and MCP tools, making flows reusable across applications and agents.

## Deployment Surfaces

| Surface | Use Case |
|:--------|:---------|
| API endpoint | app/service integration |
| MCP server | tool interoperability for agent ecosystems |

## Deployment Checklist

- version flow definitions
- enforce auth and rate limits
- log invocation traces
- validate input/output schemas

## Source References

- [Langflow Deployment Overview](https://docs.langflow.org/deployment-overview)
- [Langflow README](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow)

## Summary

You now have a practical approach for publishing Langflow workflows as reusable runtime interfaces.
