# Chapter 6: Autonomy, Control, and Debugging

Plandex supports both high autonomy and fine-grained control modes depending on task risk.

## Control Spectrum

| Mode | Best For |
|:-----|:---------|
| high autonomy | repetitive, low-risk implementation loops |
| guided control | high-risk refactors and complex migrations |

## Summary

You now know how to choose the right autonomy level and debugging posture per task.
