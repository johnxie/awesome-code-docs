## Why This Track Matters

Plandex is a terminal AI coding agent built specifically for large, multi-file, long-horizon tasks where simpler assistants often break down.

This track focuses on:

- context management for large codebases
- planning and execution loops with review sandboxing
- model pack and provider strategy optimization
- self-hosted and production deployment practices
