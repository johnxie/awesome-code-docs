# Chapter 2: Core Graph Abstraction

PocketFlow's core abstraction is a graph that models control flow and execution transitions.

- keeps framework surface area small
- enables composition into higher-level patterns

## Summary

You now understand how the graph abstraction underpins all PocketFlow capabilities.
