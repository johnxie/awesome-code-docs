# PocketFlow Tutorial: Minimal LLM Framework with Graph-Based Power

> Learn how to build agentic applications with `The-Pocket/PocketFlow`, a minimalist graph framework that still supports workflows, multi-agent patterns, RAG, and human-in-the-loop flows.

## Why This Track Matters

PocketFlow proves that useful agent frameworks can be extremely small while remaining expressive. It is ideal for developers who want clarity, control, and portability instead of heavyweight abstractions.

This track focuses on:

- core graph abstractions in a minimal framework
- composable patterns for agents, workflows, and RAG
- multi-agent and HITL design without framework bloat
- scaling lightweight patterns into real applications
