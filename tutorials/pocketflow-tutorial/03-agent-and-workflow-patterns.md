PocketFlow supports agent and workflow designs through reusable graph composition patterns.

## Pattern Set

| Pattern | Use Case |
|:--------|:---------|
| workflow | deterministic stage execution |
| agent | tool-calling and iterative reasoning |
| batch | repeated item processing |

## Summary

You now have composition patterns for turning simple nodes into full agent workflows.
