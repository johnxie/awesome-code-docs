# Chapter 4: Tooling, Environments, and Model Strategy

This chapter focuses on runtime controls that materially affect quality and cost.

## Learning Goals

- configure environment constraints and tooling safely
- select model strategies by task profile
- reduce non-deterministic behavior across runs
- control failure domains in autonomous execution

## Practical Tuning Areas

- environment isolation and dependency setup
- model selection for planning vs implementation
- tool restrictions for safer action scope
- retry/error-handling strategies in long tasks

## Summary

You now have a strategy for balancing reliability, cost, and speed in SWE-agent runs.
