# Chapter 6: Offensive Security Mode and Specialized Workloads

This chapter explains workload specialization and when to use security-focused variants.

## Learning Goals

- understand EnIGMA mode scope and constraints
- decide when specialized versions are appropriate
- isolate high-risk workflows operationally
- align capabilities with governance requirements

## Scope Notes

SWE-agent's EnIGMA path targets offensive cybersecurity challenge workflows. Keep these environments isolated and policy-governed, and follow project guidance on version alignment.
