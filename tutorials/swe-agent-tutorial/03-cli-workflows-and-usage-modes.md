# Chapter 3: CLI Workflows and Usage Modes

This chapter covers how to move between single-run and batch workflows.

## Learning Goals

- run single issues for rapid iteration
- run batch workloads for scale testing
- choose interaction patterns by task complexity
- capture artifacts for post-run analysis

## Usage Modes

- hello-world/single issue flows for focused debugging
- batch mode for benchmark-like evaluations
- custom task templates for specialized workload classes

## Summary

You can now choose the right execution mode for local debugging or scale evaluation.
