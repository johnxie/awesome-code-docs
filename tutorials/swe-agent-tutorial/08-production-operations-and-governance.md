# Chapter 8: Production Operations and Governance

This chapter maps production responsibilities for teams using autonomous coding agents.

- establish rollback and incident response protocols

## Governance Checklist

- mandatory review before merge to protected branches
- run logs and metadata retention for auditability
- periodic regression evaluation after model/config changes
