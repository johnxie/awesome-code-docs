# Chapter 7: Development and Contribution Workflow

This chapter covers how to contribute effectively while keeping changes reviewable and testable.

## Learning Goals

- use official contribution channels and issue templates
- align code changes with development guidelines
- keep PRs scoped and debuggable
- work with maintainers on roadmap-fit changes

## Contribution Pattern

- open issue context first for significant changes
- implement narrow, well-tested changes
- attach reproducible evidence for bug fixes
- use docs and Discord/issue channels for coordination
