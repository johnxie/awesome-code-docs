# Chapter 4: Sandbox, Approvals, and MCP Integration

This chapter shows how to expand Codex capability without losing safety controls.

## Learning Goals

- apply sandbox and approval boundaries deliberately
- connect MCP servers through config
- isolate risky actions by policy
- troubleshoot integration failures quickly

## Safety Strategy

- default to constrained execution where feasible
- require approvals for high-impact actions
- expose only necessary MCP servers and scopes

## Source References

- [Codex Security Docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/security)
- [Codex Sandbox Notes](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/docs/sandbox.md)
- [Codex Config Reference](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference)

## Summary

You now have a safer model for running Codex with external integrations.
