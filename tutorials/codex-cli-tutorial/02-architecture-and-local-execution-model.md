# Chapter 2: Architecture and Local Execution Model

This chapter explains how Codex CLI behaves as a local terminal agent.

## Learning Goals

- understand local-first execution boundaries
- map core components and workflow stages
- identify where policy controls apply
- reason about model/tool interactions in terminal loops

## Architecture Highlights

- terminal-native interaction model
- configurable execution and policy surfaces
- support for MCP and connector integrations
- explicit sandbox/approval controls for risky operations

## Summary

You now have a clear mental model for Codex local execution behavior.
