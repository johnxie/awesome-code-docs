# Chapter 6: Commands, Connectors, and Daily Operations

This chapter covers daily operator ergonomics in Codex CLI.

## Learning Goals

- use command surfaces for faster interaction
- integrate connectors where they improve context flow
- keep session workflows predictable
- reduce operational friction in repetitive tasks

## Operational Patterns

- use slash commands for explicit action routing
- use connectors for controlled external context
- standardize command patterns across team runbooks

## Summary

You now have efficient operator patterns for day-to-day Codex usage.
