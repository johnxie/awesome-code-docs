# Chapter 1: Getting Started and Current Product Posture

This chapter establishes where Sweep stands today and how to choose a practical adoption entry point.

## Learning Goals

- understand current repository and product posture
- choose hosted app, CLI, or self-hosting entry path
- run a first end-to-end issue workflow safely

## Product Posture Checklist

| Signal | Interpretation |
|:-------|:---------------|
| README points to JetBrains plugin | current primary product surface has shifted |
| docs still cover GitHub app and CLI | legacy workflows remain useful for study and operations |
| repo activity continues | ecosystem and operational knowledge still evolving |

## Fast Start: GitHub App Workflow

1. install Sweep in your preferred surface from [sweep.dev](https://sweep.dev)
2. open an issue prefixed with `Sweep:`
3. monitor generated PR and CI behavior
4. iterate using issue/PR comments starting with `Sweep:`

## First-Run Guardrails

- start with small, concrete tasks
- include specific filenames in issue text
- keep one behavior change per issue whenever possible

## Source References

- [README](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/blob/main/README.md)
- [Getting Started](https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/blob/main/docs/pages/getting-started.md)
- [Sweep Website](https://sweep.dev)

## Summary

You now have a realistic starting context and first execution path.
