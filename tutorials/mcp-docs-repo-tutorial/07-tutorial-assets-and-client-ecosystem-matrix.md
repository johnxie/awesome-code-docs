# Chapter 7: Tutorial Assets and Client Ecosystem Matrix

This chapter focuses on ecosystem coverage context from tutorial and client-matrix content.

## Learning Goals

- use client feature matrices for compatibility planning
- interpret tutorial assets as implementation references, not guarantees
- prioritize client-target testing by feature support profiles
- keep compatibility assumptions documented and testable

## Source References

- [Client Ecosystem Matrix](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/docs/blob/main/clients.mdx)
- [Building a Client (Node)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/docs/blob/main/tutorials/building-a-client-node.mdx)
- [Building MCP with LLMs](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/docs/blob/main/tutorials/building-mcp-with-llms.mdx)

## Summary

You now have a framework for using archived ecosystem docs in planning and validation workflows.
