# Chapter 5: Advanced Concepts: Transports, Sampling, and Roots

This chapter covers advanced protocol topics that influence real-world architecture decisions.

## Learning Goals

- evaluate transport options and security tradeoffs
- understand sampling workflows and human-in-the-loop controls
- reason about roots/context boundaries in client-server interactions
- apply best-practice constraints in production design

## Source References

- [Transports Concepts](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/docs/blob/main/docs/concepts/transports.mdx)
- [Sampling Concepts](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/docs/blob/main/docs/concepts/sampling.mdx)
- [Roots Concepts](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/docs/blob/main/docs/concepts/roots.mdx)

## Summary

You now have an advanced concept map for transport and context-design decisions.
