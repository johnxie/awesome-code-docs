# Chapter 2: Repository Layout and Canonical Migration Path

This chapter maps content areas and migration strategy between archived and active docs repositories.

## Learning Goals

- navigate major content areas (concepts, quickstarts, tools, tutorials)
- decide migration priorities for internal documentation links
- reduce broken references during docs transitions
- keep teams aligned on active update channels

## Layout Overview

|:-----|:----------|
| quickstart/ | historical onboarding reference |
| docs/concepts/ | conceptual background and terminology |
| docs/tools/ | practical debugging and inspector guidance |
| development/ | historical roadmap/update context |
