# Chapter 8: Contribution Governance and Documentation Operations

This chapter defines governance controls for teams maintaining internal MCP docs around archived upstream content.

## Learning Goals

- route external documentation contributions to active repositories correctly
- maintain internal docs synchronization with canonical MCP docs
- establish review and versioning policies for docs-derived architecture guidance
- prevent stale archive content from overriding current specification updates

## Source References

- [Archived Docs Contributing Guide](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Active MCP Docs Location](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/tree/main/docs)

## Summary

You now have a governance model for documentation operations across archived and active MCP sources.
