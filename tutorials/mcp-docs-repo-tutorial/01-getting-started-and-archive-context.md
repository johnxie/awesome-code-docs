# Chapter 1: Getting Started and Archive Context

This chapter defines the current role of the archived docs repository.

## Learning Goals

- identify the archive status and practical implications
- map when archived docs are useful vs when active docs are required
- avoid treating archived content as authoritative for new protocol changes
- establish source-of-truth expectations for your team

## Source References

- [Docs Repository README](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/docs/blob/main/README.md)
- [Canonical Docs Location](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/tree/main/docs)

## Summary

You now have a clear scope boundary for using archived docs safely.
