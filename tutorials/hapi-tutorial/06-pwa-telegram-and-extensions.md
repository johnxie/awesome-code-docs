# Chapter 6: PWA, Telegram, and Extensions

HAPI supports multiple control surfaces so users can choose the right experience for context and urgency.

## Client Surface Comparison

| Surface | Best For |
|:--------|:---------|
| PWA | full mobile/desktop remote session control |
| Telegram Mini App | fast approvals and notification-first workflow |
| terminal + runner | machine-level orchestration and spawning |

## PWA Operations

- install as home-screen app for fast access
- use notification permissions for approval alerts
- rely on cached UI for degraded connectivity scenarios

## Extension Opportunities

Use runner + machine identities to route new sessions to specific hosts based on performance, policy, or ownership.

## Summary

You can now align HAPI interfaces with operator roles and team workflow needs.
