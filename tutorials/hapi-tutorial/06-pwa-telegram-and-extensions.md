# Chapter 6: PWA, Telegram, and Extensions

HAPI provides multiple client surfaces so teams can choose how they receive and act on agent events.

## Client Surfaces

| Surface | Strength |
|:--------|:---------|
| PWA | app-like browser experience with installable workflow |
| Telegram Mini App | integrated notifications and quick approvals |
| terminal + runner | machine-targeted session orchestration |

## PWA Advantages

- installable mobile/desktop UX
- cached session views and update prompts
- notification support for approval events

## Extension Strategy

Use runner + multi-machine setup to spawn or route sessions where compute or access policy is best suited.

## Summary

You can now map HAPI interfaces to user roles and on-call workflows.
