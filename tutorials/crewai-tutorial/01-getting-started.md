research_task = Task(
    description="Research the latest developments in artificial intelligence for 2024",
    agent=researcher,
    expected_output="A comprehensive report on AI developments in 2024"
)

# Create and run the crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher],
    tasks=[research_task],
    verbose=True
)

# Execute the crew
result = crew.kickoff()
print(result)
```

### Understanding the Components

#### Agents
```python
from crewai import Agent

# Basic agent configuration
agent = Agent(
    role="Content Writer",                    # Agent's role/purpose
    goal="Create engaging content",           # Primary objective
    backstory="Expert writer with 10+ years", # Background context
    verbose=True,                            # Enable detailed logging
    allow_delegation=False                   # Can delegate to other agents
)
```

#### Tasks
```python
from crewai import Task

# Task definition
task = Task(
    description="Write a blog post about AI trends",    # What to do
    agent=agent,                                       # Which agent handles it
    expected_output="A 1000-word blog post",           # Expected result format
    context=[],                                        # Previous task context
    async_execution=False                              # Synchronous execution
)
```

#### Crew
```python
from crewai import Crew

# Crew configuration
crew = Crew(
    agents=[agent1, agent2, agent3],    # List of agents
    tasks=[task1, task2, task3],        # List of tasks
    verbose=True,                       # Enable logging
    process="sequential"                # Execution mode
)
```

## Building a Simple Research Crew

Let's create a more comprehensive example:

```python
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool
import os

# Set API keys
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-openai-key-here"
os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = "your-serper-key-here"

# Create specialized agents
researcher = Agent(
    role="Senior Research Analyst",
    goal="Conduct thorough research on complex topics",
    backstory="""You are a senior research analyst with expertise in 
    gathering and synthesizing information from multiple sources.""",
    tools=[SerperDevTool()],
    verbose=True
)

writer = Agent(
    role="Content Writer",
    goal="Create engaging and well-structured content",
    backstory="""You are an experienced content writer who excels at 
    transforming complex information into readable content.""",
    verbose=True
)

reviewer = Agent(
    role="Quality Assurance Specialist",
    goal="Ensure content quality and accuracy",
    backstory="""You are a meticulous QA specialist who reviews content 
    for accuracy, clarity, and completeness.""",
    verbose=True
)

# Define tasks
research_task = Task(
    description="""Research the impact of AI on healthcare industry in 2024. 
    Focus on: telemedicine, drug discovery, patient care, and regulatory changes.""",
    agent=researcher,
    expected_output="Comprehensive research findings with key insights and data points"
)

writing_task = Task(
    description="""Write a detailed article about AI's impact on healthcare based on the research findings.
    Include: introduction, key areas of impact, case studies, challenges, and future outlook.""",
    agent=writer,
    context=[research_task],
    expected_output="Well-structured 1500-word article ready for publication"
)

review_task = Task(
    description="""Review the article for accuracy, clarity, and completeness.
    Check for: factual accuracy, logical flow, grammar, and engagement.""",
    agent=reviewer,
    context=[writing_task],
    expected_output="Reviewed article with feedback and suggested improvements"
)

# Create the crew
healthcare_crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer, reviewer],
    tasks=[research_task, writing_task, review_task],
    verbose=True
)

# Execute the crew
result = healthcare_crew.kickoff()
print("Crew execution completed!")
print("Final result:", result)
```

    classDef process fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#ef6c00
    classDef decision fill:#fce4ec,stroke:#c2185b
    classDef end fill:#e8f5e8,stroke:#1b5e20

    class A start
    class B,C,D,E,F process
    class G decision
    class H end
```

### Process Types

```python
# Sequential execution (default)
crew = Crew(
    agents=[agent1, agent2],
    tasks=[task1, task2],
    process="sequential"  # Tasks execute one after another
)

# Hierarchical execution
crew = Crew(
    agents=[manager, worker1, worker2],
    tasks=[main_task, subtask1, subtask2],
    process="hierarchical"  # Manager delegates to workers
)
```

## Agent Configuration Deep Dive

### Advanced Agent Properties

```python
from crewai import Agent
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool, WebsiteSearchTool

# Advanced agent configuration
senior_researcher = Agent(
    role="Senior Research Analyst",
    goal="Conduct comprehensive research and analysis",
    backstory="""PhD in Computer Science with 15 years of experience 
    in AI research and analysis.""",

    # Tools for enhanced capabilities
    tools=[
        SerperDevTool(),
        WebsiteSearchTool()
    ],

    # Behavioral settings
    verbose=True,
    allow_delegation=True,
    max_execution_time=300,  # 5 minutes timeout

    # Memory and context
    memory=True,
    max_memory_items=100,

    # Custom settings
    temperature=0.7,  # Creativity level
    model="gpt-4"     # LLM model to use
)
```

### Tool Integration

```python
from crewai_tools import (
    SerperDevTool,
    WebsiteSearchTool,
    FileReadTool,
    DirectoryReadTool
)

# Tool-enabled agent
research_agent = Agent(
    role="Research Specialist",
    goal="Gather information from various sources",
    tools=[
        SerperDevTool(),        # Web search
        WebsiteSearchTool(),    # Website content extraction
        FileReadTool(),         # File reading capabilities
        DirectoryReadTool()     # Directory exploration
    ],
    verbose=True
)
```

## Error Handling and Debugging

### Basic Error Handling

```python
from crewai import Crew

try:
    crew = Crew(
        agents=[researcher, writer],
        tasks=[research_task, writing_task]
    )

    result = crew.kickoff()
    print("Success:", result)

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Crew execution failed: {e}")
    # Implement fallback logic
    fallback_result = handle_crew_failure(e)
```

### Debugging Crew Execution

```python
# Enable detailed logging
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[agent1, agent2],
    tasks=[task1, task2],
    verbose=True,           # Enable crew-level logging
    debug=True             # Enable debug mode
)

# Monitor execution
result = crew.kickoff()

# Access execution details
print("Execution summary:", crew.execution_summary)
print("Agent performance:", crew.agent_performance)
print("Task status:", crew.task_status)
```

## Best Practices for Getting Started

### Crew Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each agent should have one clear purpose
2. **Clear Communication**: Define expected inputs and outputs clearly
3. **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple and gradually add complexity
4. **Error Handling**: Always plan for potential failures
5. **Monitoring**: Track performance and iterate on design

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

```python
# ❌ Bad: Overloaded agent
overloaded_agent = Agent(
    role="Everything Expert",
    goal="Do research, writing, analysis, and project management"
)

# ✅ Good: Specialized agents
researcher = Agent(role="Research Specialist", goal="Gather information")
writer = Agent(role="Content Writer", goal="Create content")
analyst = Agent(role="Data Analyst", goal="Analyze data")
```
