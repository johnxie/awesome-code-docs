# Chapter 8: Production Operations and Governance

Production Vibe usage requires policy around approvals, tool permissions, and update cadence.

## Governance Checklist

1. define approved agent profiles by environment
2. restrict auto-approve usage to trusted, low-risk workflows
3. review skill/tool additions via normal code review
4. pin and test versions before organization-wide rollouts
5. monitor CI and release updates for behavior changes
