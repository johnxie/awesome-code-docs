# Chapter 4: Skills and Slash Command Extensions

Vibe's skills system enables reusable behavior packages and user-invocable slash command extensions.

## Skill Benefits

- codify recurring team standards
- attach specialized prompts/workflows
- expose custom slash commands where needed

## Skill Design Guidance

1. keep skill descriptions concise and task-specific
2. declare allowed tools clearly for safety
3. store skills in shared repository paths for consistency
