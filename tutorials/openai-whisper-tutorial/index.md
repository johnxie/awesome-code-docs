## What Whisper is

Whisper is an open-source speech model family trained for multilingual transcription, language identification, and speech-to-English translation.

The official repository provides:

- command-line and Python usage paths
- multiple model sizes (tiny to large, plus turbo variant)
- implementation details for tokenization and decoding behavior

## Key Practical Notes

- Whisper requires `ffmpeg` for audio decoding in most workflows.
- The `turbo` model is optimized for fast transcription but is not recommended for translation tasks.
- Accuracy and speed vary significantly by language, audio quality, and hardware.

## Tutorial Structure

| Chapter | Topic | What You Will Learn |
|:--------|:------|:--------------------|
| [1. Getting Started](01-getting-started.md) | Setup | Install Whisper, verify dependencies, and run first transcription |
| [2. Model Architecture](02-model-architecture.md) | Internals | Encoder-decoder design and multitask token behavior |
| [3. Audio Preprocessing](03-audio-preprocessing.md) | Input Quality | Resampling, normalization, segmentation, and noise handling |
| [4. Transcription and Translation](04-transcription-translation.md) | Core Tasks | Language detection, transcription, translation, and timestamps |
| [5. Fine-Tuning and Adaptation](05-fine-tuning.md) | Customization | Practical adaptation strategies and limits of official tooling |
| [6. Advanced Features](06-advanced-features.md) | Extensions | Word timestamps, diarization integrations, confidence workflows |
| [7. Performance Optimization](07-performance-optimization.md) | Throughput | Model sizing, batching, hardware acceleration, and quantization |
| [8. Production Deployment](08-production-deployment.md) | Operations | Service design, observability, retry strategy, and governance |
