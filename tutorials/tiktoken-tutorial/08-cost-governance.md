# Chapter 8: Cost Governance

This chapter closes with operational governance for token usage at scale.

## Governance Controls

- per-tenant token budgets and hard limits
- anomaly alerts for sudden token spikes
- review workflows for prompt changes with cost impact

## FinOps Integration

- attribute spend by feature/workflow
- enforce model tiering for low/high complexity requests
- prioritize caching and truncation where quality impact is minimal

## Final Summary

You now have end-to-end tiktoken practices from encoding mechanics to production cost control.
