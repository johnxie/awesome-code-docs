## 🎯 What is Fabric?

**Fabric** is an open-source framework designed to augment human capabilities using AI. It provides a modular system of "Patterns" (prompt engineering templates) and "Stitches" (composable AI workflows) that help users accomplish complex cognitive tasks more effectively.

### Key Features
- 🧩 **Modular Patterns** - Reusable prompt engineering templates
- 🔗 **Composability** - Chain patterns together for complex workflows
- 🤖 **Multi-Model Support** - Works with various AI providers
- 📚 **Extensible Library** - Community-contributed patterns
- 🎯 **Task-Specific** - Specialized patterns for different domains
- 🔧 **CLI-First Design** - Command-line interface for efficiency
- 📝 **Markdown Integration** - Seamless document processing
- 🌐 **API Access** - REST API for integrations
