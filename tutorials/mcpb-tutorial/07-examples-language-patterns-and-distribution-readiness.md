# Chapter 7: Examples, Language Patterns, and Distribution Readiness

This chapter translates specification guidance into practical implementation templates.

## Learning Goals

- evaluate official examples for runtime and structure decisions
- understand development vs production readiness boundaries
- map example patterns to your own server architecture
- prioritize distribution hardening before publishing bundles

## Example Guidance

- use hello-world examples to validate toolchain and host install loop first.
- treat example projects as reference patterns, not production blueprints.
- add your own observability, secret management, and update policies before release.

## Source References

- [MCPB Examples](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb/blob/main/examples/README.md)
- [Hello World UV Example](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb/blob/main/examples/hello-world-uv/README.md)

## Summary

You now have an example-driven framework for taking bundles from prototype to hardened distribution.
