## Why This Track Matters

OpenHands is one of the most capable open autonomous engineering agents. Teams need clear operating guidance to avoid unsafe or low-quality automation.

This track focuses on:

- bounded autonomous execution with human checkpoints
- reproducible bugfix and refactor loops
- reliable test and integration workflows
- practical scaling from local usage to team operations
