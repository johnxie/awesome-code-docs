# Chapter 2: Architecture and Runtime Components

Welcome to **Chapter 2: Architecture and Runtime Components**. In this part of **Tabby Tutorial: Self-Hosted AI Coding Assistant Architecture and Operations**, you will build an intuitive mental model first, then move into concrete implementation details and practical production tradeoffs.


Tabby is more than a single completion endpoint. It is a layered runtime that combines server services, context processing, and editor-facing agent bridges.

## Learning Goals

- map major runtime components and boundaries
- understand request flow from editor to model backend
- identify where to place custom integrations and controls

## Core Component Map

| Component | Responsibility |
|:----------|:---------------|
| Tabby server | serves completion/chat APIs and admin web UI |
| `tabby-agent` | LSP bridge between editors and Tabby APIs |
| editor extension | user interaction layer for completion/chat |
| model backends | completion/chat/embedding inference providers |
| indexing subsystem | builds repository and document context |

## Runtime Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant Ext as Editor Extension
    participant Agent as tabby-agent
    participant Srv as Tabby Server
    participant Model as Model Backend

    Dev->>Ext: trigger completion/chat
    Ext->>Agent: send LSP request
    Agent->>Srv: call Tabby API
    Srv->>Model: inference request with context
    Model-->>Srv: generated output
    Srv-->>Agent: completion/chat payload
    Agent-->>Ext: LSP response
    Ext-->>Dev: inline result
```

## Repository Structure Orientation

| Path | Why You Care |
|:-----|:-------------|
| `clients/` | extension and agent-side integration patterns |
| `crates/` | core server/runtime internals implemented in Rust |
| `website/docs/` | operational and configuration guidance |
| `ee/` | enterprise-oriented modules and integrations |

## Design Implications

- API and LSP boundaries let teams update editor adapters independently.
- Model provider abstraction enables mixed local and remote deployment strategy.
- Context indexing is a first-class system, not an optional add-on.

## Summary

You now have a structural map for where behavior lives and how requests move across Tabby.

## Depth Expansion Playbook

<!-- depth-expansion-v2 -->

This chapter is expanded to v1-style depth for production-grade learning and implementation quality.

### Strategic Context

- tutorial: **Tabby Tutorial: Self-Hosted AI Coding Assistant Architecture and Operations**
- tutorial slug: **tabby-tutorial**
- chapter focus: **Chapter 2: Architecture and Runtime Components**
- system context: **Tabby Tutorial**
- objective: move from surface-level usage to repeatable engineering operation

### Architecture Decomposition

1. Define the runtime boundary for `Chapter 2: Architecture and Runtime Components`.
2. Separate control-plane decisions from data-plane execution.
3. Capture input contracts, transformation points, and output contracts.
4. Trace state transitions across request lifecycle stages.
5. Identify extension hooks and policy interception points.
6. Map ownership boundaries for team and automation workflows.
7. Specify rollback and recovery paths for unsafe changes.
8. Track observability signals for correctness, latency, and cost.

### Operator Decision Matrix

| Decision Area | Low-Risk Path | High-Control Path | Tradeoff |
|:--------------|:--------------|:------------------|:---------|
| Runtime mode | managed defaults | explicit policy config | speed vs control |
| State handling | local ephemeral | durable persisted state | simplicity vs auditability |
| Tool integration | direct API use | mediated adapter layer | velocity vs governance |
| Rollout method | manual change | staged + canary rollout | effort vs safety |
| Incident response | best effort logs | runbooks + SLO alerts | cost vs reliability |

### Failure Modes and Countermeasures

| Failure Mode | Early Signal | Root Cause Pattern | Countermeasure |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------------|:---------------|
| stale context | inconsistent outputs | missing refresh window | enforce context TTL and refresh hooks |
| policy drift | unexpected execution | ad hoc overrides | centralize policy profiles |
| auth mismatch | 401/403 bursts | credential sprawl | rotation schedule + scope minimization |
| schema breakage | parser/validation errors | unmanaged upstream changes | contract tests per release |
| retry storms | queue congestion | no backoff controls | jittered backoff + circuit breakers |
| silent regressions | quality drop without alerts | weak baseline metrics | eval harness with thresholds |

### Implementation Runbook

1. Establish a reproducible baseline environment.
2. Capture chapter-specific success criteria before changes.
3. Implement minimal viable path with explicit interfaces.
4. Add observability before expanding feature scope.
5. Run deterministic tests for happy-path behavior.
6. Inject failure scenarios for negative-path validation.
7. Compare output quality against baseline snapshots.
8. Promote through staged environments with rollback gates.
9. Record operational lessons in release notes.

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Most teams struggle here because the hard part is not writing more code, but deciding clear boundaries for `participant`, `Agent`, `Model` so behavior stays predictable as complexity grows.

In practical terms, this chapter helps you avoid three common failures:

- coupling core logic too tightly to one implementation path
- missing the handoff boundaries between setup, execution, and validation
- shipping changes without clear rollback or observability strategy

After working through this chapter, you should be able to reason about `Chapter 2: Architecture and Runtime Components` as an operating subsystem inside **Tabby Tutorial: Self-Hosted AI Coding Assistant Architecture and Operations**, with explicit contracts for inputs, state transitions, and outputs.

Use the implementation notes around `Tabby`, `completion`, `chat` as your checklist when adapting these patterns to your own repository.

## How it Works Under the Hood

Under the hood, `Chapter 2: Architecture and Runtime Components` usually follows a repeatable control path:

1. **Context bootstrap**: initialize runtime config and prerequisites for `participant`.
2. **Input normalization**: shape incoming data so `Agent` receives stable contracts.
3. **Core execution**: run the main logic branch and propagate intermediate state through `Model`.
4. **Policy and safety checks**: enforce limits, auth scopes, and failure boundaries.
5. **Output composition**: return canonical result payloads for downstream consumers.
6. **Operational telemetry**: emit logs/metrics needed for debugging and performance tuning.

When debugging, walk this sequence in order and confirm each stage has explicit success/failure conditions.
