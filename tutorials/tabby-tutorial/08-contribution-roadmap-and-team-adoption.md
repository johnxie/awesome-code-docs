# Chapter 8: Contribution, Roadmap, and Team Adoption

This chapter closes the track with contribution mechanics and rollout strategy for engineering organizations.

## Learning Goals

- map a phased adoption plan for teams
- contribute changes to Tabby with minimal friction
- align roadmap signals with your internal platform needs

## Team Rollout Model

| Phase | Outcome |
|:------|:--------|
| pilot | small engineering group validates quality and workflow fit |
| expansion | additional teams onboard with shared policy templates |
| platformization | Tabby becomes part of standard developer environment |

## Contribution Workflow

1. clone repository with submodules when needed
2. follow `CONTRIBUTING.md` setup guidance
3. build and run tests for touched modules
4. submit focused PRs with clear behavior change notes

## Governance Checklist

- define ownership for runtime config and upgrades
- standardize model/provider policies across teams
- maintain internal runbooks for incidents and user onboarding

## Summary

You now have a full lifecycle mental model for adopting, operating, and extending Tabby as an internal coding assistant platform.

Next: pick a related implementation track such as [Continue](../continue-tutorial/) or [OpenCode](../opencode-tutorial/).
