# Chapter 3: Installation Paths Across IDEs and Agents

This chapter compares setup options across supported environments.

## Learning Goals

- choose plugin vs manual install paths correctly
- understand path conventions for different IDEs
- verify installation quickly in each environment
- avoid stale-cache and path mismatch issues

## Supported Surfaces

The repo provides setup guides for Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Cursor, and others.

## Installation Strategy

- use plugin install where supported for fastest baseline
- use manual/workspace installs when sharing team-local skills
- keep skill path conventions documented per runtime
