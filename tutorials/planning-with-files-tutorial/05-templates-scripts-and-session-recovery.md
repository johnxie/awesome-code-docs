# Chapter 5: Templates, Scripts, and Session Recovery

This chapter focuses on recovery and repeatability assets.

## Learning Goals

- use template files to standardize planning outputs
- run helper scripts for session initialization and checks
- understand automatic session-recovery behavior after `/clear`
- reduce context-loss disruption in long tasks

## Key Assets

- templates: `task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, `progress.md`
- scripts: init-session, completion checks, catchup utilities
- recovery logic: resume based on recent planning file activity

## Recovery Habit

Before resuming work, run status and catchup checks, then reconcile plan and progress files.

## Summary
