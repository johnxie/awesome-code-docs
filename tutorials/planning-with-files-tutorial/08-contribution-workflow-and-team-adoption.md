# Chapter 8: Contribution Workflow and Team Adoption

This chapter explains how to scale and evolve planning-with-files in teams.

## Learning Goals

- contribute improvements with clear compatibility notes
- standardize team onboarding and workflow contracts
- evaluate forks/extensions and adopt safely
- maintain shared quality expectations across environments

## Team Adoption Pattern

1. publish standard template and command usage policy
2. define review checks for plan/findings/progress quality
3. document IDE-specific install and support steps
4. add recovery and troubleshooting runbook to team docs

## Contribution Guidance

- keep changes scoped and backward-compatible where possible
- document behavior changes in release/changelog notes
- include examples for new rules, templates, or scripts

## Summary

You now have an end-to-end model for deploying planning-with-files across teams.

Next steps:

- define team-level template quality standards
- run pilot adoption on one active project
- contribute one improvement with docs and compatibility notes
