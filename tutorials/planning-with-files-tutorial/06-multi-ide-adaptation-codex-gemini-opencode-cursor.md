# Chapter 6: Multi-IDE Adaptation (Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, Cursor)

This chapter shows how to carry one planning workflow across multiple coding-agent environments.

## Learning Goals

- map equivalent skill installation paths across IDEs
- align command usage and behavior where syntax differs
- keep team onboarding docs consistent across tools
- avoid path/version drift in mixed environments

## Adaptation Pattern

- define one canonical workflow contract (files + cadence)
- map runtime-specific install/invocation syntax
- run cross-tool smoke tests on small tasks
