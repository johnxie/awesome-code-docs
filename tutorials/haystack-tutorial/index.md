# Haystack Tutorial: Building Intelligent Search Systems

> This tutorial is AI-generated! To learn more, check out [Awesome Code Docs](https://github.com/johnxie/awesome-code-docs)

Haystack<sup>[View Repo](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack)</sup> is an open-source framework for building search systems that work intelligently over large document collections. It enables developers to create production-ready applications with advanced NLP capabilities, including question answering, document search, and information retrieval.

Haystack provides a modular architecture that combines the best of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with powerful search capabilities, making it easy to build sophisticated AI-powered search applications.
