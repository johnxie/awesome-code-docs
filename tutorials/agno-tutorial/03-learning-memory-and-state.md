# Chapter 3: Learning, Memory, and State

Agno's differentiator is persistent learning behavior across sessions and users.

## Memory Model

| Type | Purpose |
|:-----|:--------|
| user profile memory | cross-session personalization |
| conversation memory | current dialogue continuity |
| learned shared knowledge | transferable improvements across users |

## Design Rules

- separate volatile session state from durable memory
- validate memory quality before promotion to shared knowledge
- define retention and deletion policies early
