# Chapter 6: Inspector Debugging and Chat App Workflows

Inspector is a central QA surface for validating tool contracts, prompts, and conversational behavior.

## Learning Goals

- connect and manage multiple servers in inspector sessions
- validate tools/resources/prompts before embedding in products
- test chat and prompt flows with BYOK model configuration
- use local persistence and command-palette workflows for faster iteration

## Inspector Usage Pattern

1. connect target server(s)
2. validate schema and execution for top tools
3. run prompt/chat flow checks
4. export client config and handoff to product integrations

## Summary

You now have a repeatable inspector workflow for debugging and quality validation.
