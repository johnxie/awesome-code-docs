# Chapter 7: Risk Management and Selection Rubric

This chapter provides a structured risk-aware selection framework.

## Learning Goals

- evaluate trust, maintenance, and action risk quickly
- detect high-blast-radius automations before rollout
- stage adoption to reduce operational exposure
- document keep/drop decisions with objective criteria

## Selection Rubric

| Dimension | Strong Signal | Risk Signal |
|:----------|:--------------|:------------|
| documentation | clear setup/examples/constraints | vague or generic guidance |
| maintenance | active updates and issue handling | stale or unresolved breakage |
| permissions | explicit action boundaries | unclear or broad access assumptions |
| reversibility | easy rollback and disable path | hard-to-undo destructive flows |
