# Chapter 5: App Automation via Composio Skill Packs

This chapter covers app-integrated skills that perform concrete external actions.

## Learning Goals

- understand plugin-backed app integration flow
- choose low-risk automation entry points first
- validate auth and permissions safely
- scale automation scope only after repeatable success

## Safe Rollout Pattern

1. start with one non-destructive integration
2. verify auth and dry-run style operations
3. log and review action outcomes
4. expand to write operations only with clear guardrails
