# Chapter 5: App Automation via Composio Skill Packs

This chapter covers the app-automation side of the ecosystem, where skills connect to operational systems.

## Learning Goals

- understand plugin-based app integration flow
- evaluate automation skills by action safety and reliability
- avoid broad, unsafe tool exposure during early adoption
- choose low-risk app domains for first rollout

## Practical Adoption Pattern

1. start with one non-destructive app domain
2. validate auth/connectivity with sample operations
3. verify logging and reversibility for key actions
4. expand scope only after repeatable success
