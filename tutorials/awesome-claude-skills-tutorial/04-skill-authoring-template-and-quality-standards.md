# Chapter 4: Skill Authoring Template and Quality Standards

This chapter explains what quality means for reusable skill contributions.

## Learning Goals

- apply required skill structure consistently
- write `SKILL.md` sections with clear behavior boundaries
- include examples and usage signals maintainers can verify
- design for modularity and interoperability

## Quality Baseline

| Requirement | Why It Matters |
|:------------|:---------------|
| clear when-to-use guidance | improves activation reliability |
| explicit steps/examples | reduces misinterpretation |
| concise, scoped instructions | avoids unpredictable behavior |
| category-appropriate placement | keeps catalog navigable |
