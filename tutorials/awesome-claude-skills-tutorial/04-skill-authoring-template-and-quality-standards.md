# Chapter 4: Skill Authoring Template and Quality Standards

This chapter explains what separates reusable production skills from prompt fragments.

## Learning Goals

- apply the repository's recommended skill structure
- document usage boundaries and examples clearly
- design skills for composability, not one-off demos
- prepare submissions that pass quality expectations

## Strong Skill Structure

| Component | Purpose |
|:----------|:--------|
| `SKILL.md` | core intent, usage guidance, examples |
| optional scripts/resources | support deterministic execution where needed |
| scoped instructions | explicit when-to-use and when-not-to-use boundaries |
