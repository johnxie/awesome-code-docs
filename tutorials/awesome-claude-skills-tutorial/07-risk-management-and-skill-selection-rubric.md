# Chapter 7: Risk Management and Skill Selection Rubric

This chapter provides a risk-aware framework for adopting third-party skills.

## Learning Goals

- score skills by trust, clarity, and operational impact
- identify high-risk automation behaviors early
- stage rollout to limit blast radius
- document keep/drop decisions objectively

## Selection Rubric

| Dimension | Strong Signal | Risk Signal |
|:----------|:--------------|:------------|
| documentation | clear setup, examples, constraints | vague or promotional guidance |
| maintenance | active updates and issue response | stale or unresolved breakage |
| security posture | explicit permissions and limits | unclear access boundaries |
| reversibility | easy rollback/disable path | hard-to-undo destructive actions |
