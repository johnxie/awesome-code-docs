# Chapter 1: Getting Started

This chapter sets up a fast triage loop for skill discovery and first validation.

## Learning Goals

- identify immediate workflow bottlenecks before browsing
- shortlist skills with clear usage docs
- test one skill in a constrained task
- avoid adopting overlapping or low-maintenance entries

## 15-Minute Onboarding Loop

1. open the catalog [README](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills/blob/master/README.md)
2. pick one category aligned to your current task
3. shortlist 3-5 skills with clear examples
4. run one low-risk trial
5. keep only skills with measurable benefit
