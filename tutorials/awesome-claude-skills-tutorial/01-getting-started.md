# Chapter 1: Getting Started

This chapter establishes a fast process for getting value from the skills catalog without overwhelming exploration.

## Learning Goals

- identify 3-5 candidate skills relevant to your current bottleneck
- validate skill clarity before installing anything
- run a minimal proof in your Claude environment
- avoid adopting overlapping or stale skills

## Fast Start Loop

1. start from the [README](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills/blob/master/README.md)
2. choose one category aligned to current work
3. shortlist candidate skills with clear docs and examples
4. test one skill in a constrained task
5. keep only skills with measurable outcome improvement
