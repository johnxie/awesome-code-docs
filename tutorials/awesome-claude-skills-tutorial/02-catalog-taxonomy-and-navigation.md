# Chapter 2: Catalog Taxonomy and Navigation

This chapter maps catalog sections to practical user intent.

## Learning Goals

- navigate by task type rather than browsing endlessly
- distinguish generic skills from app automation packs
- prioritize entries that are maintainable and adaptable
- reduce selection time with category heuristics

## Category Heuristics

| Category Cluster | Best For |
|:-----------------|:---------|
| development/code | implementation, tests, debugging, review |
| data/analysis | extraction, summarization, decision support |
| productivity/writing | planning, documentation, communication |
| app automation | concrete SaaS actions and operational workflows |
