# Chapter 2: Catalog Taxonomy and Navigation

This chapter helps you navigate the catalog by intent and workflow type.

## Learning Goals

- map category families to concrete task profiles
- separate general skills from app-specific automation packs
- scan quickly for high-value entries in each category
- reduce evaluation time through structured navigation

## Category Navigation Map

| Category Family | Typical Use |
|:----------------|:------------|
| development/code | implementation, testing, refactoring, review |
| data/analysis | research, summarization, query/insight workflows |
| productivity/writing | planning, docs, communication, personal ops |
| app automation | concrete SaaS task execution via tool integrations |
