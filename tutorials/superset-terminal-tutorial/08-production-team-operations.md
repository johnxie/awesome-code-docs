# Chapter 8: Production Team Operations

Team adoption of Superset needs explicit standards for workspace ownership, quality gates, and agent policy.

## Team Checklist

1. define workspace naming and ownership conventions
2. enforce review before branch merge from agent output
3. standardize setup/teardown scripts for reproducibility
4. set limits for number of concurrent agents per machine
5. track release changes and roll out incrementally

## Source References

- [Superset releases](https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/releases)

## Summary

You now have an operations baseline for running Superset as a team-scale multi-agent command center.
