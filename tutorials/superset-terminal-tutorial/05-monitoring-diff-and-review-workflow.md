# Chapter 5: Monitoring, Diff, and Review Workflow

Superset centralizes status monitoring and diff review so human decisions can happen faster across many agent tasks.

## Review Loop

1. monitor workspace status in unified view
2. inspect generated diffs quickly
3. approve/edit before committing and merging

## Source References

- [Superset README: monitoring and diff features](https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/blob/main/README.md)

## Summary

You now have a review-first flow for safely scaling agent throughput.
