# Chapter 4: Data Management

Welcome to **Chapter 4: Data Management**. In this part of **Dyad Tutorial: Local-First AI App Building**, you will build an intuitive mental model first, then move into concrete implementation details and practical production tradeoffs.


Data is the lifeblood of modern applications. In this chapter, we'll explore how to connect your Dyad applications to databases and manage data effectively.

## Database Integration

### Supported Databases

- SQLite (local development)
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL/MariaDB
- MongoDB
- Firebase/Firestore

### Connection Setup

```
Connect to a PostgreSQL database with user authentication and session management
```

## Data Models

### Defining Schemas

Create structured data models:

```
Create user model with fields: id, email, name, created_at, preferences
```

### Relationships

Establish data relationships:

```
Set up relationships between users, posts, and comments with foreign keys
```

## CRUD Operations

### Create Operations

```
Add functionality to create new records with form validation
```

### Read Operations

```
Add delete functionality with confirmation dialogs
```

## Data Validation

### Client-Side Validation

```

```

### Server-Side Validation

```
Implement backend validation with error handling and user feedback
```

## Advanced Features

```
Add search functionality and advanced filtering options
```

### Data Export

## Depth Expansion Playbook

<!-- depth-expansion-v2 -->

This chapter is expanded to v1-style depth for production-grade learning and implementation quality.

### Strategic Context

- tutorial: **Dyad Tutorial: Local-First AI App Building**
- tutorial slug: **dyad-tutorial**
- chapter focus: **Chapter 4: Data Management**
- system context: **Dyad Tutorial**
- objective: move from surface-level usage to repeatable engineering operation

### Architecture Decomposition

1. Define the runtime boundary for `Chapter 4: Data Management`.
2. Separate control-plane decisions from data-plane execution.
3. Capture input contracts, transformation points, and output contracts.
4. Trace state transitions across request lifecycle stages.
5. Identify extension hooks and policy interception points.
6. Map ownership boundaries for team and automation workflows.
7. Specify rollback and recovery paths for unsafe changes.
8. Track observability signals for correctness, latency, and cost.

### Operator Decision Matrix

| Decision Area | Low-Risk Path | High-Control Path | Tradeoff |
|:--------------|:--------------|:------------------|:---------|
| Runtime mode | managed defaults | explicit policy config | speed vs control |
| State handling | local ephemeral | durable persisted state | simplicity vs auditability |
| Tool integration | direct API use | mediated adapter layer | velocity vs governance |
| Rollout method | manual change | staged + canary rollout | effort vs safety |
| Incident response | best effort logs | runbooks + SLO alerts | cost vs reliability |

### Failure Modes and Countermeasures

| Failure Mode | Early Signal | Root Cause Pattern | Countermeasure |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------------|:---------------|
| stale context | inconsistent outputs | missing refresh window | enforce context TTL and refresh hooks |
| policy drift | unexpected execution | ad hoc overrides | centralize policy profiles |
| auth mismatch | 401/403 bursts | credential sprawl | rotation schedule + scope minimization |
| schema breakage | parser/validation errors | unmanaged upstream changes | contract tests per release |
| retry storms | queue congestion | no backoff controls | jittered backoff + circuit breakers |
| silent regressions | quality drop without alerts | weak baseline metrics | eval harness with thresholds |

### Implementation Runbook

1. Establish a reproducible baseline environment.
2. Capture chapter-specific success criteria before changes.
3. Implement minimal viable path with explicit interfaces.
4. Add observability before expanding feature scope.
5. Run deterministic tests for happy-path behavior.
6. Inject failure scenarios for negative-path validation.
7. Compare output quality against baseline snapshots.
8. Promote through staged environments with rollback gates.
9. Record operational lessons in release notes.

### Review Questions

1. Which execution boundary matters most for this chapter and why?
2. What signal detects regressions earliest in your environment?
3. What tradeoff did you make between delivery speed and governance?

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Most teams struggle here because the hard part is not writing more code, but deciding clear boundaries for `user`, `functionality`, `validation` so behavior stays predictable as complexity grows.

In practical terms, this chapter helps you avoid three common failures:

- coupling core logic too tightly to one implementation path
- missing the handoff boundaries between setup, execution, and validation
- shipping changes without clear rollback or observability strategy

After working through this chapter, you should be able to reason about `Chapter 4: Data Management` as an operating subsystem inside **Dyad Tutorial: Local-First AI App Building**, with explicit contracts for inputs, state transitions, and outputs.

Use the implementation notes around `Implement`, `fields`, `email` as your checklist when adapting these patterns to your own repository.

## How it Works Under the Hood

Under the hood, `Chapter 4: Data Management` usually follows a repeatable control path:

1. **Context bootstrap**: initialize runtime config and prerequisites for `user`.
2. **Input normalization**: shape incoming data so `functionality` receives stable contracts.
3. **Core execution**: run the main logic branch and propagate intermediate state through `validation`.
4. **Policy and safety checks**: enforce limits, auth scopes, and failure boundaries.
5. **Output composition**: return canonical result payloads for downstream consumers.
6. **Operational telemetry**: emit logs/metrics needed for debugging and performance tuning.

When debugging, walk this sequence in order and confirm each stage has explicit success/failure conditions.

## Source Walkthrough

Use the following upstream sources to verify implementation details while reading this chapter:

- [Dyad README](https://github.com/dyad-sh/dyad/blob/main/README.md)
  Why it matters: authoritative reference on `Dyad README` (github.com).
- [Dyad Releases](https://github.com/dyad-sh/dyad/releases)
  Why it matters: authoritative reference on `Dyad Releases` (github.com).
- [Dyad Repository](https://github.com/dyad-sh/dyad)
  Why it matters: authoritative reference on `Dyad Repository` (github.com).

Suggested trace strategy:
- search upstream code for `user` and `functionality` to map concrete implementation paths
- compare docs claims against actual runtime/config code before reusing patterns in production
