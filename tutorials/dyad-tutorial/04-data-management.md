- PostgreSQL
- MySQL/MariaDB
- MongoDB
- Firebase/Firestore

### Connection Setup

```
Connect to a PostgreSQL database with user authentication and session management
```

## Data Models

### Defining Schemas

### Relationships

Establish data relationships:

```
Set up relationships between users, posts, and comments with foreign keys
```

## CRUD Operations
