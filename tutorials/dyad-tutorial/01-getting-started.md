# Chapter 1: Getting Started with Dyad

Welcome to Dyad! If you've ever dreamed of building applications using just natural language, you're in the right place. Dyad opens up the exciting world of AI-powered app development, where you can describe what you want to build and watch the code come to life.

## What Makes Dyad Special?

Dyad revolutionizes app development by:

- **Natural Language Development** - Describe your app in plain English
- **AI-Powered Code Generation** - Let AI handle the complex coding
- **Local First** - Run everything on your machine for privacy
- **Open Source** - Free and customizable for everyone
- **Rapid Prototyping** - Go from idea to working app in minutes
- **Learning Tool** - Understand development concepts through AI guidance

## Installing Dyad

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have:
- Node.js 18 or later
- At least 4GB of RAM
- A modern web browser

### Installation Steps

```bash
# Clone the Dyad repository
git clone https://github.com/dyad-sh/dyad.git
cd dyad

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### First Time Setup

1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. You'll see the Dyad welcome screen
3. Click "Create New Project"
4. Choose a project name and template

## Your First AI-Generated App

Let's create a simple to-do list app:

1. **Describe Your App**: Type in the prompt box:
   ```
   Create a to-do list app where users can add, edit, and delete tasks
   ```

2. **Generate**: Click the "Generate" button

3. **Review**: Dyad will show you the generated code and preview

4. **Customize**: Modify the prompt to add features:
   ```
   Add categories for tasks and a due date picker
   ```

## Understanding the Interface

### Main Components

- **Prompt Input**: Where you describe your app requirements
- **Code Editor**: Shows the generated code
- **Preview Panel**: Live preview of your app
- **Component Library**: Pre-built components you can use
- **Settings**: Configure AI models and preferences

### Workflow

1. **Plan**: Think about what your app should do
2. **Describe**: Write a clear, detailed prompt
3. **Generate**: Let Dyad create the initial code
4. **Refine**: Make adjustments and add features
5. **Test**: Try out your app in the preview
6. **Deploy**: Share or export your finished app

## Tips for Better Prompts

### Be Specific
Instead of: "Make a blog"
Try: "Create a blog with user authentication, post creation, comments, and categories"

### Include Features
- User interface elements
- Data structures
- Functionality requirements
- Styling preferences

### Example Prompts

**Simple App**:
```
Build a weather app that shows current conditions and 5-day forecast
```

**Complex App**:
```
Create an e-commerce store with product catalog, shopping cart, user accounts, and payment integration
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**App Won't Generate**
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure you have enough RAM available
- Try simplifying your prompt

**Preview Not Loading**
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for errors
- Clear browser cache

**Code Errors**
- Review the generated code for syntax issues
- Use the "Fix Errors" button in Dyad
- Manually edit the code in the editor

## Next Steps

Congratulations on creating your first AI-generated app! In the next chapter, we'll explore more advanced prompting techniques to build sophisticated applications.
