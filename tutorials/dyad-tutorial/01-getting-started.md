## Installing Dyad

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have:
- Node.js 18 or later
- At least 4GB of RAM
- A modern web browser

### Installation Steps

```bash
# Clone the Dyad repository
git clone https://github.com/dyad-sh/dyad.git
cd dyad

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### First Time Setup

1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. You'll see the Dyad welcome screen
3. Click "Create New Project"
4. Choose a project name and template

## Your First AI-Generated App

Let's create a simple to-do list app:

1. **Describe Your App**: Type in the prompt box:
   ```
   Create a to-do list app where users can add, edit, and delete tasks
   ```

2. **Generate**: Click the "Generate" button

3. **Review**: Dyad will show you the generated code and preview

4. **Customize**: Modify the prompt to add features:
   ```
   Add categories for tasks and a due date picker
   ```

## Understanding the Interface

### Main Components

- **Prompt Input**: Where you describe your app requirements
- **Code Editor**: Shows the generated code
- **Preview Panel**: Live preview of your app
- **Component Library**: Pre-built components you can use
- **Settings**: Configure AI models and preferences

### Workflow

1. **Plan**: Think about what your app should do
2. **Describe**: Write a clear, detailed prompt
3. **Generate**: Let Dyad create the initial code
4. **Refine**: Make adjustments and add features
5. **Test**: Try out your app in the preview
6. **Deploy**: Share or export your finished app

## Tips for Better Prompts

### Be Specific
Instead of: "Make a blog"
Try: "Create a blog with user authentication, post creation, comments, and categories"

### Include Features
- User interface elements
- Data structures
- Functionality requirements
- Styling preferences

### Example Prompts

**Simple App**:
```
Build a weather app that shows current conditions and 5-day forecast
```

**Complex App**:
```
Create an e-commerce store with product catalog, shopping cart, user accounts, and payment integration
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**App Won't Generate**
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure you have enough RAM available
- Try simplifying your prompt

**Preview Not Loading**
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for errors
- Clear browser cache

**Code Errors**
- Review the generated code for syntax issues
- Use the "Fix Errors" button in Dyad
- Manually edit the code in the editor

## Next Steps

Congratulations on creating your first AI-generated app! In the next chapter, we'll explore more advanced prompting techniques to build sophisticated applications.

## Depth Expansion Playbook

<!-- depth-expansion-v2 -->

This chapter is expanded to v1-style depth for production-grade learning and implementation quality.

### Strategic Context

- tutorial: **Dyad Tutorial: Local-First AI App Building**
- tutorial slug: **dyad-tutorial**
- chapter focus: **Chapter 1: Getting Started with Dyad**
- system context: **Dyad Tutorial**
- objective: move from surface-level usage to repeatable engineering operation

### Architecture Decomposition

1. Define the runtime boundary for `Chapter 1: Getting Started with Dyad`.
2. Separate control-plane decisions from data-plane execution.
3. Capture input contracts, transformation points, and output contracts.
4. Trace state transitions across request lifecycle stages.
5. Identify extension hooks and policy interception points.
6. Map ownership boundaries for team and automation workflows.
7. Specify rollback and recovery paths for unsafe changes.
8. Track observability signals for correctness, latency, and cost.

### Operator Decision Matrix

| Decision Area | Low-Risk Path | High-Control Path | Tradeoff |
|:--------------|:--------------|:------------------|:---------|
| Runtime mode | managed defaults | explicit policy config | speed vs control |
| State handling | local ephemeral | durable persisted state | simplicity vs auditability |
| Tool integration | direct API use | mediated adapter layer | velocity vs governance |
| Rollout method | manual change | staged + canary rollout | effort vs safety |
| Incident response | best effort logs | runbooks + SLO alerts | cost vs reliability |

### Failure Modes and Countermeasures

| Failure Mode | Early Signal | Root Cause Pattern | Countermeasure |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------------|:---------------|
| stale context | inconsistent outputs | missing refresh window | enforce context TTL and refresh hooks |
| policy drift | unexpected execution | ad hoc overrides | centralize policy profiles |
| auth mismatch | 401/403 bursts | credential sprawl | rotation schedule + scope minimization |
| schema breakage | parser/validation errors | unmanaged upstream changes | contract tests per release |
| retry storms | queue congestion | no backoff controls | jittered backoff + circuit breakers |
| silent regressions | quality drop without alerts | weak baseline metrics | eval harness with thresholds |

### Implementation Runbook

1. Establish a reproducible baseline environment.
2. Capture chapter-specific success criteria before changes.
3. Implement minimal viable path with explicit interfaces.
4. Add observability before expanding feature scope.
5. Run deterministic tests for happy-path behavior.
6. Inject failure scenarios for negative-path validation.
7. Compare output quality against baseline snapshots.
8. Promote through staged environments with rollback gates.
9. Record operational lessons in release notes.

### Quality Gate Checklist

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Most teams struggle here because the hard part is not writing more code, but deciding clear boundaries for `dyad`, `Create`, `tasks` so behavior stays predictable as complexity grows.

In practical terms, this chapter helps you avoid three common failures:

- coupling core logic too tightly to one implementation path
- missing the handoff boundaries between setup, execution, and validation
- shipping changes without clear rollback or observability strategy

After working through this chapter, you should be able to reason about `Chapter 1: Getting Started with Dyad` as an operating subsystem inside **Dyad Tutorial: Local-First AI App Building**, with explicit contracts for inputs, state transitions, and outputs.

Use the implementation notes around `Clone`, `Dyad`, `repository` as your checklist when adapting these patterns to your own repository.

## How it Works Under the Hood

Under the hood, `Chapter 1: Getting Started with Dyad` usually follows a repeatable control path:

1. **Context bootstrap**: initialize runtime config and prerequisites for `dyad`.
2. **Input normalization**: shape incoming data so `Create` receives stable contracts.
3. **Core execution**: run the main logic branch and propagate intermediate state through `tasks`.
4. **Policy and safety checks**: enforce limits, auth scopes, and failure boundaries.
5. **Output composition**: return canonical result payloads for downstream consumers.
6. **Operational telemetry**: emit logs/metrics needed for debugging and performance tuning.

When debugging, walk this sequence in order and confirm each stage has explicit success/failure conditions.

## Source Walkthrough

Use the following upstream sources to verify implementation details while reading this chapter:

- [Dyad README](https://github.com/dyad-sh/dyad/blob/main/README.md)
  Why it matters: authoritative reference on `Dyad README` (github.com).
- [Dyad Releases](https://github.com/dyad-sh/dyad/releases)
  Why it matters: authoritative reference on `Dyad Releases` (github.com).
- [Dyad Repository](https://github.com/dyad-sh/dyad)
  Why it matters: authoritative reference on `Dyad Repository` (github.com).

Suggested trace strategy:
- search upstream code for `dyad` and `Create` to map concrete implementation paths
- compare docs claims against actual runtime/config code before reusing patterns in production
