> This tutorial is AI-generated! To learn more, check out [Awesome Code Docs](https://github.com/johnxie/awesome-code-docs)

Dyad<sup>[View Repo](https://github.com/dyad-sh/dyad)</sup> is a free, local, open-source AI app builder that enables developers to create applications using natural language prompts. It provides an intuitive interface for building AI-powered applications without extensive coding knowledge.

Dyad allows users to describe their app requirements in plain English and generates the corresponding code, making app development accessible to non-technical users while maintaining the power and flexibility needed by developers.
