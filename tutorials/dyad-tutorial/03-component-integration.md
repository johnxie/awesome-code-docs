# Chapter 3: Component Integration

Now that you can build apps with natural language, let's explore how to enhance them with additional components and functionality. Dyad provides a rich component library that you can integrate into your applications.

## Understanding Components

Components are reusable building blocks that add specific functionality to your apps. They range from simple UI elements to complex features like charts and data tables.

## Available Component Categories

### UI Components

- **Navigation**: Menus, breadcrumbs, tabs
- **Layout**: Grids, cards, containers
- **Forms**: Inputs, selects, checkboxes, date pickers
- **Feedback**: Modals, tooltips, notifications

### Data Components

- **Tables**: Sortable, filterable data tables
- **Charts**: Bar charts, line graphs, pie charts
- **Lists**: Infinite scroll, search, filtering
- **Cards**: Product cards, user profiles, content tiles

### Interactive Components

- **Buttons**: Various styles and states
- **Dropdowns**: Multi-select, searchable
- **Sliders**: Range selectors, volume controls
- **Tabs**: Content organization

## Adding Components to Your App

### Using Prompts

```
Add a data table component to display user information with sorting and filtering
```

```
Include a chart component to visualize sales data with bar and line graphs
```

### Component Configuration

Specify component properties:

```
Add a form with input validation, dropdown menus, and file upload capability
```

## Advanced Integration Techniques

### Component Composition

Combine multiple components:

```
Create a dashboard with:
- Navigation sidebar
- Stats cards in a grid layout
- Data table with pagination
- Chart components for visualization
```

### Custom Styling

Apply themes and styles:

```
Style the components with a dark theme and custom color scheme
```

### Responsive Design

Ensure mobile compatibility:

```
Make all components responsive for mobile and tablet devices
```

## Component Libraries

### Built-in Components

Dyad includes many pre-built components:
- Material UI components
- Ant Design elements
- Custom Dyad components

### Third-Party Integration

Add external component libraries:

```
Integrate React Bootstrap components for additional UI elements
```

## Best Practices

### Performance

- Use lazy loading for large component libraries
- Optimize component re-renders
- Minimize bundle size with tree shaking

### Accessibility

- Ensure components meet WCAG guidelines
- Add proper ARIA labels
- Support keyboard navigation

### Consistency

- Use consistent styling across components
- Follow design system guidelines
- Maintain component naming conventions

## Troubleshooting

### Component Not Rendering

- Check component imports
- Verify prop types
- Review console errors

### Styling Issues

- Inspect CSS conflicts
- Use CSS modules for isolation
- Check component specificity

## Next Steps

You've learned how to integrate components into your Dyad applications. In the next chapter, we'll explore data management and database connections.
