# Chapter 4: Parallel Agent Orchestration

Parallel agent sessions can improve throughput, but only when orchestration is explicit and controlled.

## Orchestration Rules

| Rule | Purpose |
|:-----|:--------|
| isolate task scopes | avoid cross-session collisions |
| keep shared context curated | reduce contradictory outputs |
| use structured handoff notes | preserve continuity |
| enforce review before merge | maintain quality |

## Summary

You now understand how to scale from single-agent workflows to coordinated parallel execution.
