# Chapter 2: Architecture and Monorepo Layout

HumanLayer uses a monorepo layout that supports multiple workflow surfaces and tooling paths.

## Key Areas

| Area | Focus |
|:-----|:------|
| `apps/` | end-user application surfaces |
| `packages/` | reusable shared libraries |
| docs and scripts | workflow guidance and automation |
| CLI-related dirs (`hld`, `hlyr`) | command workflows and tooling |

## Summary

You now know where to inspect and extend key parts of the HumanLayer codebase.
