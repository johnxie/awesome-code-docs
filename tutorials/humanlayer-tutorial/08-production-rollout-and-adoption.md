# Chapter 8: Production Rollout and Adoption

This chapter outlines a rollout model for adopting HumanLayer workflows across teams.

## Rollout Phases

1. pilot with strict guardrails
2. expand to high-leverage teams
3. standardize policies and templates
4. operationalize review and incident playbooks

## Adoption Risks

- over-automation without policy gates
- context quality drift across teams
- cost escalation without telemetry controls

## Summary

You now have a phased adoption strategy for scaling coding-agent workflows with human governance.
