# Chapter 3: Context Engineering Workflows

Context engineering is central to making coding agents reliable in complex repositories.

## Core Pattern

1. narrow problem statement and scope
2. curate minimal, high-signal context
3. enforce explicit task boundaries
4. iterate with measured review loops

## Why It Works

- reduces agent drift
- lowers token waste
- improves repeatability across teammates

## Source References

- [HumanLayer README](https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer/blob/main/README.md)
- [humanlayer.md](https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer/blob/main/humanlayer.md)

## Summary

You now have a repeatable context workflow pattern for hard coding tasks.
