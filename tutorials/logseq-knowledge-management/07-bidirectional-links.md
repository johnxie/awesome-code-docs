# Chapter 7: Bi-Directional Links

Bi-directional linking is the core mechanism behind connected-note discovery.

## Link Lifecycle

1. user types `[[page]]` reference
2. parser records outgoing edge
3. target page accumulates backlink edge
4. graph view/search indexes both directions

## Practical Benefits

- contextual discovery of related notes
- automatic backlink maintenance
- emergent structure without rigid folders

## Summary

You now understand how Logseq builds a navigable knowledge graph from inline references.
