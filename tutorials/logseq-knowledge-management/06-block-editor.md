# Chapter 6: Block Editor

The Logseq editor handles hierarchical editing and reference-centric workflows.

## Core Behaviors

- indentation controls parent-child structure
- slash commands drive structured inserts
- reference syntax creates graph edges inline
- keyboard-first navigation optimizes flow

## Reliability Concerns

- selection consistency across nested edits
- undo/redo across structure + text changes
- low-latency edits on large page trees

## Summary

You can now analyze editor behavior as structured graph mutations.
