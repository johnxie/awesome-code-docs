# Chapter 8: Graph Visualization

This chapter covers graph rendering patterns and large-graph usability.

## Visualization Pipeline

- query graph neighborhood around selected node
- compute layout coordinates incrementally
- render nodes/edges with interaction affordances
- support filters by page type, tag, or depth

## Performance Controls

- cap rendered node count per frame
- progressive expansion on interaction
- cache layout results for repeated views

## Final Summary

You now have full Logseq foundations from philosophy to graph visualization.
