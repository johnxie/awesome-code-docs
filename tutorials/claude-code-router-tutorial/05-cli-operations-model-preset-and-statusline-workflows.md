# Chapter 5: CLI Operations: Model, Preset, and Statusline Workflows

This chapter focuses on operator workflows that reduce manual JSON editing overhead.

- standardize workflow setup across machines

## High-Value Commands

```bash
ccr model
ccr preset export <name>
ccr preset install <source>
ccr preset list
ccr statusline
```
