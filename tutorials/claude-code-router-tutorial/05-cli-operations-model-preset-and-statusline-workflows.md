# Chapter 5: CLI Operations: Model, Preset, and Statusline Workflows

This chapter covers operator workflows that reduce manual config management.

## Learning Goals

- export/install presets for repeatable environment setup
- use statusline for real-time session visibility
- standardize config movement across machines

## High-Value Command Set

```bash
ccr model
ccr preset export <name>
ccr preset install <source>
ccr preset list
ccr statusline
```
