# Chapter 6: Library Onboarding and Documentation Quality

This chapter explains how library maintainers can improve Context7 output quality.

## Learning Goals

- submit libraries quickly through Context7 workflow
- use `context7.json` for advanced parsing control
- tune include/exclude rules for cleaner context
- manage versioned documentation availability

## Quality Controls

| Config Area | Why It Matters |
|:------------|:---------------|
| include/exclude folders | removes noisy or outdated content |
| rules section | communicates best practices to coding agents |
| previous versions | enables historical compatibility queries |
