# Chapter 7: Submission and Contribution Workflow

This chapter explains how contributors submit and maintain plugins in the official directory context.

## Learning Goals

- understand external submission path and expectations
- prepare plugin documentation and structure for review
- use reference plugins and toolkit assets for faster alignment
- avoid common contribution-quality failures

## Contribution Paths

- external plugins are submitted through the directory submission process

## Contributor Preparation Checklist

- plugin structure matches directory contract
- README includes setup, usage, and constraints
- optional MCP/hook integrations are documented clearly
- commands and skills are scoped and testable
