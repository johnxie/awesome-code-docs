# Chapter 8: Governance and Enterprise Plugin Portfolio Management

This chapter provides a governance model for enterprise-scale plugin adoption.

## Learning Goals

- design plugin approval and lifecycle governance
- map plugin capabilities to compliance and security policies
- build portfolio review loops for capability and risk optimization
- keep developer velocity high while controlling operational exposure

## Governance Framework

- approved baseline plugin set by function
- risk classification for plugin categories
- periodic review and recertification
- incident-response playbook for plugin regressions

## Enterprise Practices

- require explicit rationale for every new plugin
- prefer narrowly scoped plugins over broad opaque bundles
- pair plugin rollout with observability and rollback readiness
