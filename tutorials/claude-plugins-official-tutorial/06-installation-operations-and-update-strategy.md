# Chapter 6: Installation, Operations, and Update Strategy

This chapter covers repeatable operations for long-lived plugin portfolios.

## Learning Goals

- standardize installation and discovery workflows
- manage updates without destabilizing critical tasks
- monitor plugin behavior and usage value over time
- retire low-value or high-risk plugins cleanly

## Operations Checklist

- maintain approved plugin baseline by team role
- review plugin changes on a fixed cadence
- keep quick rollback plan for problematic plugin updates
- track active command usage to reduce dead plugin load

## Update Strategy

- stagger updates across teams/environments
- validate command behavior after update before broad rollout
- maintain known-good snapshots for incident fallback
