# Chapter 8: Production Operations, Security, and Contribution

This chapter consolidates day-2 operations practices, upgrade strategy, and contribution workflows.

## Learning Goals

- run stable production operations with predictable upgrade paths
- apply security and observability controls to flow execution
- align contribution workflow with maintainers' expectations
- sustain long-term platform quality under growth

## Operations Playbook

1. track changelog and breaking changes before upgrades
2. validate deployment/runtime configs in staging
3. monitor flow failures, queue health, and execution latency
4. maintain internal runbooks for incident response and rollback
5. contribute upstream improvements through focused PRs
