# Chapter 1: Getting Started

This chapter provides a fast path to first workflow value with minimal setup overhead.

## Learning Goals

- choose an installation path that matches your current stage
- run the platform locally and validate a first flow
- understand where key operational settings live
- establish a reproducible team onboarding baseline

## Fast Start Workflow

2. choose Docker or Docker Compose for first-run setup
3. validate platform startup and account access
4. create one simple trigger-action flow
5. capture setup and validation notes in a short team runbook
