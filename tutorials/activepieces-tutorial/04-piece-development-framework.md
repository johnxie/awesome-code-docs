# Chapter 4: Piece Development Framework

This chapter explains how to extend Activepieces through custom TypeScript pieces.

## Learning Goals

- understand piece lifecycle: definition, auth, action, trigger
- set up local piece development efficiently
- apply piece versioning rules for backward compatibility
- contribute pieces without destabilizing existing flows

## Piece Development Path

1. set up local dev environment and start the platform
2. define piece metadata and authentication
3. add actions and triggers incrementally
4. test behavior in local flow runs
5. version and publish with explicit compatibility intent
