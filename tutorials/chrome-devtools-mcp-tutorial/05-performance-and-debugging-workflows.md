# Chapter 5: Performance and Debugging Workflows

This chapter shows how to diagnose performance and runtime problems with MCP tooling.

## Learning Goals

- collect traces and inspect performance insights
- analyze network and console signals
- use snapshots/screenshots for reproducible debugging
- triage frontend regressions quickly

## Workflow Pattern

1. navigate to target page and stabilize state
2. run performance trace and insight analysis
3. inspect network and console anomalies
4. apply fixes and re-run trace for confirmation

## Summary

You now have an end-to-end debugging and performance analysis workflow.
