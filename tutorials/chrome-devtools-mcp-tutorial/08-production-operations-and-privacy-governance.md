# Chapter 8: Production Operations and Privacy Governance

This chapter covers operational governance for teams using browser-connected MCP tooling.

## Learning Goals

- manage telemetry and privacy settings deliberately
- define policy around sensitive browser data exposure
- enforce change controls for production MCP configs
- maintain observability and incident response readiness

## Governance Priorities

- document when to disable usage statistics
- avoid processing sensitive personal data in shared sessions
- restrict MCP usage scope to approved environments
- standardize logging and redaction practices
