# Chapter 2: Section Design and Instruction Quality

This chapter covers how to write instructions that agents can execute reliably.

## Learning Goals

- choose high-impact section categories
- write deterministic operational instructions
- avoid ambiguous language and hidden assumptions
- make tradeoffs explicit for better agent choices

## High-Signal Sections

- environment/tooling setup expectations
- build/test/lint command requirements
- PR and branching conventions
- safety constraints and prohibited actions

## Source References

- [AGENTS.md README Example](https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md/blob/main/README.md)
- [AGENTS.md Project Site](https://agents.md)

## Summary

You now understand how section quality directly impacts agent behavior quality.
