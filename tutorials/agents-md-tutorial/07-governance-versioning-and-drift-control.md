# Chapter 7: Governance, Versioning, and Drift Control

This chapter ensures AGENTS.md stays trustworthy as repositories evolve.

## Learning Goals

- establish ownership and review cadence
- detect stale instructions and command drift
- version instruction changes deliberately
- tie guidance updates to codebase changes

## Governance Practices

- require AGENTS.md updates when build/test workflows change
- include instruction drift checks in periodic repo audits
- assign clear document owners per repository

## Source References

- [AGENTS.md Repository Governance Discussions](https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md/issues)
- [AGENTS.md Sample File](https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md/blob/main/AGENTS.md)

## Summary

You now have governance patterns to keep agent guidance accurate over time.
