# Chapter 4: Repository Structure and Scope Strategy

This chapter focuses on scoping AGENTS.md guidance in complex repositories.

## Learning Goals

- define root-level guidance clearly
- handle subproject-specific overrides safely
- reduce conflicts in monorepos
- keep ownership boundaries explicit

## Scope Patterns

- root AGENTS.md for global policies
- subdirectory AGENTS.md where workflows diverge
- explicit precedence and conflict-resolution rules

## Source References

- [AGENTS.md Standard Repository](https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md)
- [AGENTS.md Website](https://agents.md)

## Summary

You now can scale AGENTS.md patterns from small repos to monorepos.
