# Chapter 3: Tool-Agnostic Portability Patterns

This chapter explains how to keep instructions effective across multiple coding-agent tools.

## Learning Goals

- avoid vendor-specific lock-in where unnecessary
- write commands and policies in neutral terms
- preserve behavior consistency across agents
- maintain one source of truth for project guidance

## Portability Strategy

- prefer universal shell commands and repo paths
- isolate tool-specific notes to explicit sections
- keep core expectations independent of any single agent

## Source References

- [AGENTS.md Repository](https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md)
- [AGENTS.md File in This Repo](https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md/blob/main/AGENTS.md)

## Summary

You now have a pattern for multi-agent portability without duplicated docs.
