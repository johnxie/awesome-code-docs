# Chapter 1: Getting Started

This chapter gets your first AGENTS.md in place with immediate practical value.

## Learning Goals

- create a minimal AGENTS.md scaffold
- document dev/test/PR expectations clearly
- avoid vague or contradictory instructions
- validate that agent behavior improves in practice

## Fast Start Pattern

- add `AGENTS.md` at repository root
- include dev environment, test, and PR guidance first
- keep instructions concrete and executable

## Source References

- [AGENTS.md README](https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md/blob/main/README.md)
- [Sample AGENTS.md File](https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md/blob/main/AGENTS.md)

## Summary

You now have a usable AGENTS.md baseline.
