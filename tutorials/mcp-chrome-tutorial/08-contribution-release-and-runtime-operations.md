# Chapter 8: Contribution, Release, and Runtime Operations

This chapter closes with contribution mechanics and release-aware operations for teams maintaining MCP Chrome deployments.

## Learning Goals

- follow contribution standards and project structure conventions
- use changelog/release signals to plan safe upgrades
- define long-term operational ownership

## Operations Checklist

1. monitor release notes and changelog before upgrades
2. test native registration and key tools in staging
3. track client compatibility for transport and schema changes
4. document rollback path for bridge/runtime failures
