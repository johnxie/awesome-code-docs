# Chapter 1: Getting Started and Archived Context

This chapter establishes baseline setup and risk framing for an archived dependency.

## Learning Goals

- install and run `use-mcp` quickly in React projects
- evaluate implications of archived upstream maintenance
- decide where `use-mcp` fits in short-term vs long-term roadmaps
- reduce lock-in risk before deep integration

## Baseline Setup

```bash
npm install use-mcp
```

Treat initial adoption as an integration reference layer and keep migration options open.

## Source References

- [use-mcp README](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/use-mcp/blob/main/README.md)
- [use-mcp Repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/use-mcp)

## Summary

You now have a setup and risk baseline for evaluating `use-mcp` usage.
