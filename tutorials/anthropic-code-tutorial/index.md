# Anthropic API Tutorial: Build Production Apps with Claude

> A practical guide to building with Anthropic's API and official SDKs, including messages, tools, vision, streaming, and production operations.

[![TypeScript SDK](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-anthropics%2Fanthropic--sdk--typescript-black?logo=github)](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-typescript)
[![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-console.anthropic.com-blue)](https://docs.anthropic.com/)

## Why This Track Matters

Anthropic's API is now a core building block for many production AI products. Teams need more than basic examples to ship safely.

This track focuses on:

- reliable messages API usage across SDKs
- tool-use patterns for real integrations
- multimodal and streaming UX workflows
- production controls for latency, cost, and reliability

## Current Snapshot (auto-updated)
