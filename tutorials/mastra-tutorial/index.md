## Why This Track Matters

Mastra is one of the strongest TypeScript-first frameworks for shipping AI agents beyond prototypes. It combines model routing, workflow control, memory systems, and production observability in one stack.

This track focuses on:

- agent and workflow architecture in TypeScript
- robust context, memory, and retrieval design
- MCP and ecosystem integration patterns
- evaluation and operations needed for reliable production launches
