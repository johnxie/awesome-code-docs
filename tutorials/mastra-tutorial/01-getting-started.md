# Chapter 1: Getting Started

This chapter gets your first Mastra project running and ready for real agent experimentation.

## Learning Goals

- bootstrap a new Mastra app with CLI
- run a local agent flow
- understand basic project structure
- verify provider credentials and environment setup

## Quick Start

```bash
npm create mastra@latest
cd <your-project>
npm install
npm run dev
```

Follow the generated prompts and load provider credentials before first agent execution.

## First Validation Checklist

- project boots without runtime errors
- sample agent responds correctly
- local tool invocation path works
- logs are visible for debugging
