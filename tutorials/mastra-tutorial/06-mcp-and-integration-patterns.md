# Chapter 6: MCP and Integration Patterns

Mastra can expose and consume MCP-compatible capabilities, making it a strong fit for multi-agent ecosystems.

## Integration Surfaces

| Surface | Outcome |
|:--------|:--------|
| MCP servers | structured tool/resource interoperability |
| frontend frameworks | interactive AI product experiences |
| backend runtimes | API and job-driven agent execution |

## Integration Checklist

- version and document each exposed tool contract
- enforce auth and tenancy boundaries
- monitor tool latency and failure rates
