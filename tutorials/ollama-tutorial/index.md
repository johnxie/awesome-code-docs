## Why This Track Matters

Ollama is one of the most adopted local-LLM runtimes. Teams use it for privacy-sensitive workloads, cost control, and offline-capable development.

This track focuses on:

- practical local model operations
- model configuration and customization workflows
- embeddings/RAG application patterns
- production deployment and performance tuning
