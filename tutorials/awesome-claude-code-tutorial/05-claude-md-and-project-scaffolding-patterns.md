# Chapter 5: `CLAUDE.md` and Project Scaffolding Patterns

This chapter covers how to adapt shared `CLAUDE.md` patterns into your local project standards.

## Learning Goals

- identify reusable sections in existing `CLAUDE.md` examples
- separate universal guidance from project-specific constraints
- avoid brittle all-caps policy files that drift from reality
- evolve a living `CLAUDE.md` backed by real workflow evidence

## Practical Template Pattern

| Section | Purpose | Keep It Tight |
|:--------|:--------|:--------------|
| coding standards | style, architecture, naming | only rules you enforce |
| test workflow | command set + pass criteria | exact commands |
| safety constraints | forbidden operations, data boundaries | explicit and auditable |
| contribution flow | branch/PR and verification expectations | aligned to real process |

## Summary

You now have a pattern for building maintainable `CLAUDE.md` guidance from curated examples.
