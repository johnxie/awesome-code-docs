# Chapter 1: Getting Started

This chapter sets up a fast, repeatable way to extract value from the list without getting lost in volume.

## Learning Goals

- navigate the list based on your immediate task
- choose the right README style for exploration vs maintenance
- shortlist candidate resources with basic risk checks
- avoid common low-signal adoption mistakes

## 15-Minute Workflow

1. open the root [README](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code/blob/main/README.md)
2. identify your task type first: skills, hooks, commands, tooling, or `CLAUDE.md`
3. scan `Latest Additions` for recent high-velocity entries
4. jump to category sections and capture 3-5 candidates
5. run a quick safety/maintainability pass before adoption

## First-Pass Selection Filters

| Filter | What To Check | Why It Matters |
|:-------|:--------------|:---------------|
| maintenance | recent commits/issues activity | lowers abandonment risk |
| documentation | setup clarity, examples, caveats | faster evaluation and safer use |
| interoperability | can it be adapted without full lock-in? | reduces migration cost |
| security posture | clear permissions and risk notes | avoids unsafe defaults |

## Summary

You now have a concrete triage loop for using the list efficiently.
