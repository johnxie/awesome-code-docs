# Chapter 8: Contribution Workflow and Governance

This chapter covers how to contribute responsibly to a curated repository with automated workflows.

## Learning Goals

- follow the recommendation and review process correctly
- frame submissions around user value instead of promotion
- align with safety and maintenance expectations
- make contributions that are easy to validate and merge

## Contribution Workflow

1. use the official recommendation issue flow
2. provide concrete value evidence and setup clarity
3. respond quickly to validation failures or change requests
4. keep scope narrow and verifiable per submission

## Governance Priorities

- user safety over growth metrics
- selective curation over raw volume
- strong documentation and reproducibility
- explicit constraints and transparent maintenance policies
