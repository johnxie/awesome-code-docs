# Chapter 2: List Taxonomy and Navigation

This chapter maps the repository's category system and view modes so navigation remains intentional.

## Learning Goals

- map category intent to concrete user needs
- pick the right list style for your current work
- use flat list views for scanning velocity and freshness
- avoid context-switch overhead while comparing candidates

## Category Map

| Category | Best Used For | Typical Outcome |
|:---------|:--------------|:----------------|
| Agent Skills | reusable capabilities and role specialization | faster task execution quality |
| Hooks | lifecycle enforcement and automation | consistency and policy control |
| Slash-Commands | repeatable task prompts | reduced prompt overhead |
| Tooling | wrappers, integrations, operators | better workflow ergonomics |
| `CLAUDE.md` Files | project-specific operating constraints | stronger local reliability |
| Workflows & Guides | end-to-end process design | better execution strategy |

## Choosing a README Style

| Style | Use Case | Entry Point |
|:------|:---------|:------------|
| Awesome | straightforward curation browsing | [README](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code/blob/main/README.md) |
| Classic | minimal visual noise | [README_CLASSIC.md](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code/blob/main/README_ALTERNATIVES/README_CLASSIC.md) |
| Extra | richer visual navigation | [README_EXTRA.md](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code/blob/main/README_ALTERNATIVES/README_EXTRA.md) |
| Flat | sorting/filtering via generated permutations | [README_FLAT_ALL_UPDATED.md](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code/blob/main/README_ALTERNATIVES/README_FLAT_ALL_UPDATED.md) |

## Summary

You now understand how to navigate by intent and choose the right list rendering mode.
